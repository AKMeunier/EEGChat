Sue:  Let's go hang out at the coffee shop.
Jane:  We always hang out at the coffee shop.  Let's do something else.
Sue:  I thought you loved hanging out there.  
Jane:  I do, but today I want to do something different.
Sue:  Well, I feel like relaxing with a cup of coffee.
Jane:  How about this?  We will go to the coffee shop and have a cup of coffee and talk for a while.  After that, we will take a stroll around the lake.
Sue:  That sounds like a good compromise.  
Jane:  But you are buying the coffee.
Sue:  Haha.  That is fair.

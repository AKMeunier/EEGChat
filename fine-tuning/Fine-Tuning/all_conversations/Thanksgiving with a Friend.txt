JOHN: "Hi Steve. Why aren't you packing? Aren't you going home for Thanksgiving?"
STEVE: "Hey John. No, the airplane ticket is too expensive."
JOHN: "Oh, that's too bad. What are you going to do for Thanksgiving then?"
STEVE: "I'm just going to spend it here in the dormitory."
JOHN: "But the college campus will be closed and most of our friends will be going home for the weekend."
STEVE: "I know. I'll just use the time to study."
JOHN: "That's not fun. Would you like to come over to my house this weekend?"
STEVE: "No, that's ok. I don't want to be a burden."
JOHN: "Don't be silly. You won't be a burden. My mom always makes too much food. All of relatives come over. We have a great time."
STEVE: "Are you sure? I would really like that."
JOHN: "Of course I'm sure. We have plenty of room too."
STEVE: "Thanks. You're a great friend."
JOHN: "You're welcome! Now, you better start packing. I'm leaving soon."
STEVE: "What time are we leaving?"
JOHN: "3 o'clock. It's a three hour drive from here."
STEVE: "Ok. Let me pay for gas."
JOHN: "We can each pay half."
STEVE: "Sounds great! Thanks again. I'll be ready soon."

KAREN: "Hi Susan."
SUSAN: "Hi Karen."
KAREN: "I'm thinking about throwing Bobby a birthday party in the backyard."
SUSAN: "That sounds like a great idea. Have you checked the weather?"
KAREN: "The weather is going to be sunny this weekend."
SUSAN: "That's perfect for an outdoor party."
KAREN: "I want to do a barbeque and have games."
SUSAN: "I can help you."
KAREN: "That would be wonderful."
SUSAN: "Have you thought of what you want to serve?"
KAREN: "I want to do something simple like grill hot dogs with potato chips."
SUSAN: "I can bake a cake for you."
KAREN: "Wow! That is so kind of you. Are you sure?"
SUSAN: "It would be my pleasure."
KAREN: "Can I pay you?"
SUSAN: "No. It is my gift to Bobby."
KAREN: "Thank you very much. I really appreciate it."
SUSAN: "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
KAREN: "No. Baking the birthday cake is plenty."
SUSAN: "Ok. Let me know if there is anything else you need."

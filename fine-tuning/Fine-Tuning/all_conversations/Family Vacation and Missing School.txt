DAVID: "Hi Joe. Why are you taking all of your books home?"
JOE: "Hey David. I won't be in school next week. My family is going on vacation."
DAVID: "Where are you going?"
JOE: "To Disneyland, the amusement park in California."
DAVID: "I know where it is. I've been there before. It's a fun place."
JOE: "This will be my first trip. I'm excited."
DAVID: "There are a lot of fun roller coasters to ride on."
JOE: "My mom can't go on them. She has motion sickness."
DAVID: "That's too bad. But why are you taking your school books home?"
JOE: "I'm going to miss one week of school, so I need to do homework while I'm there."
DAVID: "You're going to do homework on vacation?"
JOE: "Yeah. I don't want to be behind in class."
DAVID: "You're a good student."
JOE: "Well, my parents are making me bring my books."
DAVID: "I would be against it."
JOE: "Then I won't be going to Disneyland."

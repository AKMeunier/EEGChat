CAROL: "Hi Joan. Your garden is looking beautiful."
JOAN: "Thank, Carol. I've been working hard on it."
CAROL: "It looks like you have."
JOAN: "I water my flowers regularly and I use a good fertilizer."
CAROL: "My garden looks terrible. No matter how hard I try, everything dies."
JOAN: "Are you using a good fertilizer?"
CAROL: "I think so. I also water my flowers regularly and trim any dead leaves."
JOAN: "You're doing all of the right things."
CAROL: "I don't know what's wrong."
JOAN: "Maybe you don't have a green thumb."
CAROL: "What is a green thumb?"
JOAN: "A green thumb means you have good gardening skills."
CAROL: "Oh. Then I definitely do not have a green thumb."
JOAN: "My dad used to love gardening. I learned everything from him."
CAROL: "Can you teach me?"
JOAN: "Sure. But I can't guarantee anything."

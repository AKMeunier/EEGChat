JEFF: "Hey Bill, what are you doing on the fourth of July?"
BILL: "Hi Jeff. My family and I are going to the park to watch the fireworks."
JEFF: "The park?"
BILL: "We do that every year. It has become our annual family tradition."
JEFF: "That's a great tradition. Does it get crowded there?"
BILL: "Yes! It gets very crowded, so we leave early and just hang out at the park all day."
JEFF: "Is there parking available?"
BILL: "Yes, but it is very limited."
JEFF: "What time do you get there?"
BILL: "We usually go around 4 pm. The fireworks show starts around 6 pm."
JEFF: "Do you take your dog?"
BILL: "No. He doesn't like loud noises. It scares him. A couple of years ago, he ran away during the fireworks show."
JEFF: "That's terrible. Poor dog."
BILL: "So, now we leave him with my parents on the fourth of July. Their neighborhood is very quiet."
JEFF: "Your parents don't like fireworks?"
BILL: "Not anymore. They say it's too loud. Their neighborhood does not allow fireworks."
JEFF: "Why?"
BILL: "They say it's too loud and dangerous."
JEFF: "Oh, I understand. That's why I watch the fireworks on TV."
BILL: "That's a quiet and safe place to watch them."

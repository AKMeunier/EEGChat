A: Are you locked out of your apartment?
B: It appears that I am.
A: Did you forget your key inside your apartment?

B: Really? Do you have another key?
A: No, but the landlord does.
B: He doesn't live here though.
A: I have his phone number. I'll just give him a call.
B: Thank you. If you want, I'll talk to him myself.
A: No, don't worry. I talk to him for you.
B: Please I insist. I should be the one to ask for help since I'm the one who's in need of it.
A: Alright, suit yourself.

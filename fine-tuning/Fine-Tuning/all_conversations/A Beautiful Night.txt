JANICE: "Hi Sarah. What are you doing outside so late at night?"
SARAH: "Oh hi Janice. I couldn't sleep. What are you doing here?"
JANICE: "I come out here once in a while to look at the stars. Aren't they beautiful?"
SARAH: "Yes, they are. I never really paid attention to them."
JANICE: "You're lucky tonight. The sky is clear, so the stars are very bright."
SARAH: "We have a telescope, but we never use it. I may need to bring it outside one day."
JANICE: "That's awesome. I wish we had one."
SARAH: "You can borrow ours."
JANICE: "That would be great! I've always been interested in astronomy."
SARAH: "What's that?"
JANICE: "Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other objects in outer space."
SARAH: "That would be really interesting to study."
JANICE: "Yeah. I took a college class in astronomy once. It was fascinating."
SARAH: "Look at the moon! It's a full moon."
JANICE: "Yeah, didn't you see it earlier tonight?"
SARAH: "No. I didn't notice it earlier. What a beautiful sight."
JANICE: "It's supposed to be clear tomorrow night too. Do you want to meet out here again?"
SARAH: "Sure. How about 11 pm?"
JANICE: "I'll be here."
SARAH: "I'll bring my telescope."

A: I always get so emotional at weddings.
B: Me too, especially when I see the bride and groom kiss.
A: The bride looked so beautiful.
B: She did, and the groom looked so dapper in his tux.
A: I'll see you at the reception in a little bit.
B: No, you won't, because I wasn't invited.
A: Oh, I'm so sorry. Maybe your invite was lost in the mail.
B: It's okay. Why don't you bring me as your plus one?
A: Actually no, because I'm going with my husband.
B: Please take pictures so I can see how nice everyone looked.
A: I'm sure there will be pictures online afterwards.
B: It's not the same as being there.

SAM: "Hey Joe. What are you doing today?"
JOE: "Oh, hey Sam. I'm going furniture shopping with my wife."
SAM: "Are you looking for anything special?"
JOE: "Yeah. We need a new sofa. Our old one is ripping."
SAM: "We just bought a new sofa."
JOE: "Did you get a good deal?"
SAM: "Yeah, it was on sale. You should go check it out."
JOE: "Where did you go?"
SAM: "We went to the new store across the street."
JOE: "I saw a flyer for that in the mail. I think that's where my wife wants to go."
SAM: "If you bring the flyer, you get 10% off this weekend."
JOE: "That's good to know! Thanks for telling me."
SAM: "Do you know what kind of sofa you want?"
JOE: "Yeah. We want a dark brown leather sofa."
SAM: "That's exactly what we bought."
JOE: "Your wife and my wife must have the same taste in furniture."

Bill:  Were you here yesterday?
Stan:  No.  I don't come into the office every day.
Bill:  Do you work from home?
Stan:  Yes.  I just make sure I work 40 hours a week.
Bill:  You're so lucky.
Stan:  I know.  My boss gave me a flexible schedule because I am a single parent.
Bill:  You have a very understanding boss.
Stan:  I know.  I'm very lucky.  
Bill:  I would love to work from home.  The traffic to work is terrible.
Stan:  Maybe you should ask your boss about working a flexible schedule too.

A: Did you bring the mail in today?
B: Yeah. I got it right here.
A: Oh, great. I'm waiting for my unemployment check. It's late.
B: Sorry to tell you, your payment didn't come today.
A: No way. Darn it! It's more than a week late!
B: Why don't you call EDD? I think they can tell you where it is.
A: I definitely need to call them.
B: I think it's an automated system.
A: Oh darn. I don't like automated systems.
B: The EDD system is not so bad.
A: Okay, I'll call. This is the longest the check has taken to get to me.
B: If you have problems with the system, you can speak to a person by dialing "0".

SARAH: "Hi Jane. Isn't it a beautiful day?"
JANE: "Hi Sarah. Yeah, it's sunny and clear. I think we're going to take our boat out."
SARAH: "It's a great day for it."
JANE: "Would you and Paul like to join us?"
SARAH: "I would love to. I need to ask Paul. He's at the store. He should be home in a few minutes."
JANE: "Great! We can pack a lunch and eat on the boat."
SARAH: "Sounds like fun. I've never been on a boat before."
JANE: "You haven't? Do you get seasick?"
SARAH: "I've never been on a boat so I wouldn't know."
JANE: "Do you get airsick? Do you have any kind of motion sickness?"
SARAH: "I don't think so. I don't get sick on planes or trains or long car rides."
JANE: "That's good. Then you'll probably be ok on the boat."
SARAH: "Are you really worried about me being seasick?"
JANE: "Yes and there is a reason why."
SARAH: "What is it?"
JANE: "Tom and I took my friend out on our boat once and she got very sick. I felt terrible for her."
SARAH: "Oh, I see. I should be ok."
JANE: "What about Paul?"
SARAH: "He used to be a fisherman. He is definitely not going to be seasick."

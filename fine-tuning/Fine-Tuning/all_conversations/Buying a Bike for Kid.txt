SALESPERSON: "Hi. How can I help you today?"
MOM: "I'm looking for a bike for my daughter."
SALESPERSON: "How old is your daughter?"
MOM: "She is five years old. This will be her first bike."
SALESPERSON: "We have lots of cute bikes for girls. Does she like a particular color?"
MOM: "Yes, her favorite color is purple."
SALESPERSON: "We have a few purple bikes. Let me show you."
MOM: "I really like this one. This has stars on it. She loves stars."
SALESPERSON: "Would you like to add a basket to the front of the bike?"
MOM: "That would be wonderful. How much is this bike?"
SALESPERSON: "$50."
MOM: "That's a little more than I wanted to spend. Do you have anything cheaper?"
SALESPERSON: "Unfortunately, this is one of the least expensive bikes we have."
MOM: "I see."
SALESPERSON: "This bike has an adjustable height. So, it will grow a few inches as your child grows."
MOM: "That's a great feature. I think I will buy it. What is your return policy?"
SALESPERSON: "We have a 100% money-back guarantee."
MOM: "What does that mean?"
SALESPERSON: "You can return it for a full refund if you are not satisfied with the product."

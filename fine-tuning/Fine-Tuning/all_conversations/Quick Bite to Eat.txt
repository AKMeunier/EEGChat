CHARLIE: "Hey Jesse, should we grab a bite to eat before the concert?"
JESSE: "Yeah, I'm getting a little hungry."
CHARLIE: "Let's get some fast food here."
JESSE: "Burgers and fries?"
CHARLIE: "Yeah, that sounds good."
JESSE: "Why is the drive-thru line so long?"
CHARLIE: "It's dinner time. Should we go inside?"
JESSE: "It might be busier inside?"
CHARLIE: "Looks like the line is really long inside too."
JESSE: "Let's head to another place."
CHARLIE: "Can we go to one closer to the concert arena?"
JESSE: "That's a good idea!"
CHARLIE: "There are many fast food places around there."
JESSE: "Yeah, we should be able to find one that's not too crowded."
CHARLIE: "Fast food is great. Fast and cheap."
JESSE: "But not very healthy."

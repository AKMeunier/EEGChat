Susie:  Should we go to the beach or the mountains this year?
Tom:  I like the mountains so we can ski.
Susie:  I like the beach so we can swim.
Tom:  We can go to the beach during the summer and the mountains during the winter.
Susie:  That's a great idea.  Two family vacations in one year.  
Tom:  The kids will love that.

Bob:  Let's arrange a meeting for next week.
Joann:  Sounds good.  How about Tuesday at 11 AM?
Bob:  That works for me.  Should we meet in my office?
Joann:  How about a lunch meeting?
Bob:  Even better!  Let's meet at the restaurant across the street.
Joann:  We can negotiate our business contract then.

Tyler:  Hey Winston, are you still here?
Winston:  Yeah.  I have to work overtime tonight.
Tyler:  I thought you had dinner plans with your wife.
Winston:  I did.  But my boss wants me to finish this report.
Tyler:  Isn't it your anniversary today?
Winston:  Yes.  My wife is not happy.
Tyler:  You should tell your boss you have anniversary plans tonight.
Winston:  He won't care.  Business is more important to him.
Tyler:  That's terrible.  You should find another job.
Winston:  That's what my wife said too.

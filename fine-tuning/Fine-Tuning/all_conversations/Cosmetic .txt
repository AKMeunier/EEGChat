What’s your favorite cosmetic item?
My favorite cosmetic item is a cherry red lipstick.
When did you buy it?
I bought it in a local cosmetic shop.
How often do you use it?
Almost every day. I sometimes change the color.
How did it change your physical appearance?
Oh. At first, I was hesitant to try because I thought it wouldn’t match my skin undertone, but when putting it on, the cherry red color did make me more charming and gorgeous.
Is it expensive?
Nope. It is under $21only.
Is the brand name famous?
Yes, I think. M.A.C is well-known all around the world. M.A.C lipstick is an iconic product of the producer.
How important are cosmetics according to you?
Well, frankly, cosmetics are really important to women although I agree that the true beauty does come from inside.
Is it important to have a good-looking appearance?
Sure. You will be given more opportunities if you’re good-looking.
Are cosmetics harmful?
Yes, I guess. Some toxic chemicals in cosmetics may cause skin cancer.
Do think beauty products are a waste of money?
Not really as for me, I just spend my saving money on cosmetics.

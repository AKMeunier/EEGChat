BOB: "Hey Steve. Where are you going with all of that baseball gear?"
STEVE: "Oh, hi Bob. I coach my son's baseball team. We're having our first practice today."
BOB: "How old is your son?"
STEVE: "8 years old. He's been playing baseball for a couple of years."
BOB: "Does he like it?"
STEVE: "He loves it! This is my first year as a coach. I'm pretty excited."
BOB: "It sounds exciting. I used to play baseball in college."
STEVE: "What position did you play?"
BOB: "Pitcher. But I had to quit because of a shoulder injury."
STEVE: "That's too bad. Do you miss it?"
BOB: "Not anymore. I'm too old to play now."
STEVE: "My son is a pitcher too. Maybe you can give him some tips on how to throw."
BOB: "Sure. I'm always free in the afternoon."
STEVE: "We have our first game next Saturday. Would you like to come and watch?"
BOB: "That would be fun. What time is the game?"
STEVE: "10 am."
BOB: "Ok. Can I bring my wife?"
STEVE: "Of course."

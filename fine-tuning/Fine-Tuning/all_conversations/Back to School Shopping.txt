KATHY: "Hi Jane. What are you doing today?"
JANE: "Hi Kathy. I'm going back-to-school shopping with the kids."
KATHY: "We did that last week."
JANE: "Are there any good sales going on?"
KATHY: "Yeah, the mall is having great sales."
JANE: "Good. I need to buy clothes and shoes for my daughter. She has outgrown all of her clothes."
KATHY: "Really? My kids are still wearing the same size."
JANE: "Jenny grew four inches during the summer."
KATHY: "Wow! That's amazing!"
JANE: "I know. She eats a lot these days."
KATHY: "Probably because she is growing. Do you need to buy school supplies, too?"
JANE: "Yeah, I will be shopping for clothes, shoes, and school supplies today."
KATHY: "I'm glad I'm done. The mall was really crowded last week. I think everyone is shopping for school."
JANE: "I do not like crowds. We should've done this earlier. We always wait until the last minute every year."
KATHY: "Good luck! I hope you find everything you need."
JANE: "Thanks. It's going to be a long day."

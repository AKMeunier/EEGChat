Michelle:  What are you doing this weekend?
Monica:  I have so much to do!
Michelle:  Why are you always so busy?
Monica:  Because I have two jobs and I go to school part-time!  
Michelle:  I'm sorry.  Did I make you upset?
Monica:  No.  I just have a lot of stress.
Michelle:  Can I help you?
Monica:  Not really.  It's just work and school stuff.  
Michelle:  You need to make time for yourself.
Monica:  I know.  Let's get dinner together next weekend.

CATHY: "Hi Helen. This is Cathy. I have great news!"
HELEN: "What is it?"
CATHY: "I got the job!"
HELEN: "Congratulations! I knew you would get it."
CATHY: "Thanks! I'm so excited. I beat out 4 other applicants."
HELEN: "That's great! When is your first day of work?"
CATHY: "Next Monday."
HELEN: "What are you going to do for the next few days?"
CATHY: "I'm going to go shopping for some new suits. We have to dress nicely in the office."
HELEN: "Have you told anyone else yet?"
CATHY: "No, I wanted to tell you first. You're my best friend."
HELEN: "Well, we should celebrate."
CATHY: "Ok! What should we do?"
HELEN: "I'll buy you dinner."
CATHY: "You don't have to do that."
HELEN: "I know. But you can buy me dinner after you get your first paycheck."
CATHY: "That's a deal!"

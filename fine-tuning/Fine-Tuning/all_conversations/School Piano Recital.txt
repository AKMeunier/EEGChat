MOM: "What's wrong, Susie?"
SUSIE: "Mom, I don't want to go to the piano recital tomorrow."
MOM: "Why?"
SUSIE: "I'm really nervous and afraid."
MOM: "But haven't you been practicing every day for this?"
SUSIE: "Yeah, I've practiced almost every day for three months, but I'm afraid I'm going to mess up."
MOM: "I've heard you play. You're terrific."
SUSIE: "My piano teacher says I'm ready, but I don't think I am."
MOM: "I was very nervous at my first piano recital too. It's normal to feel this way."
SUSIE: "You were nervous, too?"
MOM: "Yes, but I got out there and I played the best I could."
SUSIE: "Then you were fine?"
MOM: "Yes. Everyone clapped and then we had ice cream afterwards."
SUSIE: "Can we have ice cream afterwards?"
MOM: "Of course."
SUSIE: "Ok. I'll do it."
MOM: "Susie, I don't want you to do something you don't want to."
SUSIE: "Mom, I'll be ok. I was just a little nervous. Thank you for your support."

A: I just got off the phone with the EDD.
B: What did they say? Are you going to get benefits?
A: Yes, but not as much as I thought.
B: What do you mean?
A: I thought I would receive a certain amount per month, but I got less.
B: Why is that?
A: I'm not really sure. It has something to do with how much I earned.
B: They pay benefits based on your income?
A: Yes. I think the more you earn, the more you receive.
B: That's interesting. I didn't know that.
A: I think I may go to the EDD office to ask about it.
B: You should go. What have you got to lose?

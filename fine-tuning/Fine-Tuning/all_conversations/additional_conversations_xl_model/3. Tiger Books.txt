A: Hi, can you help me find a book on tigers?
B: Yes, of course. Is it for a school project?
A: Yes, I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger.
B: You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures.
A: But I want the one with pictures!
B: Pictures are pretty, but they won't help you with your essay that much.
A: Fine, I admit you're right.
B: You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure.
A: Yay! I love tigers.
B: I have a book that isn't hard to understand, but still has great information.
A: Great! You're so helpful.
B: It's my job to be helpful.

A: Hi Katy, this is John.
B: Oh, hey. How are you?
A: I'm great. I wanted to thank you for going out with me last Friday.
B: I'm glad you had a good time.
A: You didn't seem to enjoy it that much.
B: To be honest, I didn't like the movie you picked.
A: I thought a horror movie would be a great way for us to get close to each other.
B: You were a little too hands on.
A: Why don't we try again next weekend?
B: I really don't think so.
A: Are you interested in going out with me again at all?
B: You should probably lose my number.

A: I'm registering for Psych 21, because I need it to transfer.
B: I need that class too in order to transfer.
A: But there's only one space left!
B: That's terrible. My registration time is at 5 p.m.
A: Darn it! Mine is at 6 p.m. 
B: That sucks. Maybe someone will drop out.
A: I doubt it. Psych 21 is needed by a lot of people.
B: Beg the professor?
A: If I have to.
B: You should cry! That might work.
A: I'm planning to. I can cry on demand.
B: Maybe you should take a theater class instead.

A: Excuse me. Can I have a minute of your time, please?
B: Sure, what is it?
A: I'm trying to take the bus to Downey, but I don't know where to take the bus.
B: Downey? Let me think. Are you visiting relatives there?
A: My girlfriend actually is the one I'm going to visit.
B: That's sweet. I'm sorry, small talk helps me remember.
A: In that case, let me ask where are you going to?
B: I'm going to work. I take the bus there every day.
A: You must save plenty of money on gas and insurance.
B: Yup, I sure do. Wait, now I remember which bus takes you to Downey!
A: Can you tell me where to take it?
B: Sure. You need to take it on Florence Avenue in the city of Bell.

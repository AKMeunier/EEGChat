A: Do you have any news for me, Daniel?
B: Yes, sir. I do.
A: That's good to hear. It's been a while since I've heard from you.
B: We not have only one offer for your home, we have two.
A: Are they both serious offers?
B: Yes, sir, they are.
A: Okay, let's go over them.

B: The offers are the same in dollars, but they placed no conditions on the sale.
A: Really? They will buy as it is?
B: Yes, sir, they will.
A: Okay. I think we found our buyer then.

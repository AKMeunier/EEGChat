A: I desperately need to take an English class this semester.
B: So does everyone else.
A: It's the only class I need before I transfer.
B: Maybe you can pay someone for their spot. 
A: I honestly would do that if someone was willing to give up their spot.
B: What happens if you can't get the class?
A: Then I need to stay at Pasadena City College longer.
B: That would stink.
A: I know, that's why I need that class.
B: You can try taking it at another college.
A: I might do that. The closest community college is a two-hour drive.
B: I'm praying you get the English class.

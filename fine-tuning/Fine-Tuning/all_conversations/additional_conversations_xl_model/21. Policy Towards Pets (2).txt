A: Everything seems to be in order. I'm ready to move into the apartment.
B: Good, I welcome you to your new home.
A: Is there anything else I should know before I start my move?
B: Now that you mention it, yes, there is. It's the policy I have on pets.
A: Do you allow any kind of pets?
B: Only caged pets, I'm sorry to say. I hope this won't be a problem.
A: Actually, I might prove to be problematic because I have a cat.
B: There lies the problem. I'm sorry, but some of the other tenants have allergies to cats.
A: That's too bad. I don't know what I'm going to do with the kitten.
B: Perhaps you can give it away. Do you know of anyone who might want a cat?
A: No, not really. What about you? Would you like a cat?
B: Me? Well, I've never owned a pet before, let alone a cat.
A: Cats make great companions. Please take mine. You would be doing me a huge favor.
B: Alright, why not? Bring the little fellow next time.

A: I'm checking out, but is there a place I can store my luggage for a few hours?
B: Why do you need us to hold your luggage, sir?
A: My flight doesn't leave for another four hours.
B: We can hold your luggage, but there is an additional cost associated with that service.
A: How much is it going to cost me?
B: It will be $6 an hour.
A: I'm going to drink at your hotel bar. Can you hook me up?
B: Unfortunately, sir, we cannot. Shall I take your credit card?
A: No, forget it. It's cheaper for me to use a locker at the airport.
B: Those airport lockers are not always safe though.
A: I'll take my chances.
B: Good luck with that, sir.

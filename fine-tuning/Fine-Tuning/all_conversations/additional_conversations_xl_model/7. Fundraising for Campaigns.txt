A: Would you be interested in donating to our candidate's campaign today?
B: Maybe. Can you tell me more about why you are raising money?
A: Sure! Campaign ads are expensive, so we want to raise money for TV ads.
B: Some of those ads are so negative though.
A: You're right, but the new ads are going to be positive.
B: How much money are you trying to raise?
A: We need a few thousand dollars
B: Is this the only way you are raising money?
A: No. We are doing phone banking and even having an event.
B: What kind of event?
A: We are hosting a lunch with the candidate.
B: I may be interested in donating for that.

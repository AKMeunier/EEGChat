A: The counteroffer we've been waiting for is here, Mr. Richards.
B: Finally. It's been nearly three weeks.
A: Well, these things take some time.
B: I know, but I wasn't happy with the original offer.
A: I think you'll be happy with this. The buyer is coming in just below list.
B: Exactly how much?
A: They came in at $415,000, with very few conditions.
B: Wow! That's only $10,000 below list. I didn't expect that.
A: Neither did I, Mr. Richards.
B: What are the conditions?
A: They're not too bad. Mostly just to fix a few minor flaws.
B: That's great. I think we'll take this counteroffer.

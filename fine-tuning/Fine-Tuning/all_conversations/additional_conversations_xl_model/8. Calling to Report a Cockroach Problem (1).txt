A: Hi, I'm calling from room 117, and there is a big problem.
B: I'm so sorry. What seems to be the issue?
A: The issue is a huge disgusting cockroach in my bathroom.
B: Is it just one cockroach?
A: Yeah, there is only one, but it's the size of my hand!
B: Why don't you just kill it?
A: I shouldn't have to kill cockroaches while I'm on vacation.
B: Do you want me to send someone to kill it for you?
A: You can send someone, but I also want to be moved to a different room.
B: I don't know if we have any other rooms available right now.
A: Well, I'm not staying in this room if there are gigantic roaches sharing it with me.
B: I'll send someone to your room right away to see if we can move you.

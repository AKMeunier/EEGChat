A: Wow! Our order is sure taking long.
B: Yes, it is. It's been nearly 45 minutes now.
A: Well, maybe they're just very busy.
B: I don't know, dear. I was watching our waiter.
A: What did you see?
B: He actually handed in orders for two tables before us.
A: You mean after he took our order.
B: Yes. He was goofing off. I could see him from here.
A: How do you know he did this.
B: Like I said, I was watching. He forgot our order.
A: That's terrible.
B: Yes, well he's not going to get a good tip from me.

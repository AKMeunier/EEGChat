A: Hello, neighbor. I just moved into the apartments last week. I have a question.
B: Sure. What do you need to know?
A: I need to locate the laundry room. I have a load of clothes to wash.
B: There is one downstairs.
A: Thank you very much.
B: There is also another located in the basement of the neighboring building.
A: Do I have to pay at a front desk?
B: No, the machines require exact change. I suggest you take quarters.
A: Does the laundry room carry detergent?
B: Yes, but I recommend you take your own. They're expensive.
A: That's good to know. Thanks again and have a nice day.
B: No problem. See you around.

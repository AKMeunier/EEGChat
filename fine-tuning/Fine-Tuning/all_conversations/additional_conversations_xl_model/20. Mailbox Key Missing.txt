A: Have you seen my mailbox key lying around somewhere?
B: No, I'm sorry. Where did you last leave it?
A: I thought it was in my pocket.
B: Is that where you last put it?
A: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
B: Think hard. Where was it before you supposedly put in your pocket?
A: I was in my apartment cleaning out the kitchen.
B: Maybe you emptied your pockets while you were cleaning.
A: Wait! I think I did empty my pockets!
B: There you go. I knew it.
A: I remember now. My keys are on the kitchen counter.
B: That's a relief.

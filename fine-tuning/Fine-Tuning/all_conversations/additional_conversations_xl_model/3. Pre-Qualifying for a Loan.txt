A: The best way to buy a house is to get pre-qualified, Ms. Anderson. 
B: Why is that, Mr. Williams?
A: By pre-qualifying, you know beforehand which house you can buy.
B: I thought I would look at houses first.
A: That's okay too, but you may be wasting your time.
B: How so, Mr. Williams?
A: You may find a house you really like, but can't afford it.
B: Well, that's when I'll negotiate with the seller.
A: Yes, that's true, but by pre-qualifying, you'll save time, and effort.
B: How is that?
A: You will be able to select a home you know you can afford.
B: Okay. Then we'll try it your way.

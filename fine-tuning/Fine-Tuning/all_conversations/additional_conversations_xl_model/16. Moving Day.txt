A: I think the movers are here, Brian.
B: They're here? They are early.
A: Yes, I know. They're an hour early.
B: We're not ready yet. I'll tell them to come back.
A: No, that's okay, dear. I'll go talk to them.
B: Are you sure?
A: Yes, they can start loading the furniture while we pack the small stuff.
B: I guess that's okay.
A: We'll be fine. Most of the furniture is in the front anyway.
B: As long as they don't get in our way.
A: I'll tell them we're not done packing. It should be okay.
B: It'd better be. They're very early.

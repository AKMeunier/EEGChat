A: Wow! Your books are over the due date by one month.
B: It would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record.
A: What kind of hold is on your record?
B: A hold that won't let me go to the college football game.
A: Oh, that's tough.
B: Yeah. My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader, and so I have to go.
A: You're not going to like what I'm going to say.
B: What is it?
A: I can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.
B: Is it a technical error?
A: I don't know! I just can't remove it!
B: If my girlfriend breaks up with me, I'm blaming you.

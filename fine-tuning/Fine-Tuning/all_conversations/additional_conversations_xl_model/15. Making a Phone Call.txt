A: Hi! How are you?
B: I'm doing good. How are you?
A: I'm great, but a little nervous.
B: Why is that?
A: I have a phone interview for a job in an hour.
B: A phone interview? That's great!
A: It is, but I'm convinced I'm going to mess it up.
B: Oh, you shouldn't say that. You'll be fine.
A: I wish I had your confidence.
B: Just relax, and be yourself. A phone interview is easier than in person.
A: That's right. I wasn't looking at it that way.
B: Be yourself. Don't pretend to be anyone else, and you'll do well.

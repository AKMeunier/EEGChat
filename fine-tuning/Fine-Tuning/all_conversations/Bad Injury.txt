JOAN: "Hey Carol, have you seen Tom lately?"
CAROL: "Didn't you hear the news?"
JOAN: "No. What happened?"
CAROL: "He got into a car accident last week."
JOAN: "Is he ok?"
CAROL: "No. He's in the hospital. He broke both of his legs and ribs. He also has a head injury."
JOAN: "That's terrible. I had the flu, so I haven't seen or talked to anyone lately. How's Judy?"
CAROL: "Judy has come home a couple of times to get a change of clothes."
JOAN: "She must be devastated."
CAROL: "She is a very worried wife."
JOAN: "Have you seen him?"
CAROL: "Bob and I visited him in the hospital a couple of days ago. He is on so much medication."
JOAN: "Wow! That's serious."
CAROL: "Yeah."
JOAN: "Does Judy know how long he's going to be in the hospital?"
CAROL: "The doctors told her he may be there for several months."
JOAN: "Oh my goodness. What is she going to do?"
CAROL: "Their children are helping her right now. They're taking turns staying at the hospital."
JOAN: "That's good. I better visit him soon. Thanks for the information."

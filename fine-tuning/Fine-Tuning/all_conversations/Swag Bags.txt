Anna:  Are you going to the hospitality event?
Joann:  Yes.  I have a few clients attending. 
Anna:  Great!  This year we're doing a raffle and gift bags.
Joann:  Raffle and gift bags?  Isn't that a little childish?
Anna:  The raffle prize is a sports car and the gift bags are filled with jewelry.
Joann:  Are you serious?  Can our company afford this?
Anna:  The CEO wants to keep our clients happy.  
Joann:  That's definitely going to keep them happy.
Anna:  It'll probably attract more clients to our company too.

Have you ever been in any traffic accident?
Yes, three years ago.
What happened?
I was hit by a car while crossing the road.
How did you feel then?
I felt really terrible because of my injuries.
Who was involved in the accident?
The car driver, his family (inside the car), and me.
Did the insurance company pay for repair service?
I was walking so I did not require any car repair services.
Did you need a lawyer?
I hurt my lower back just a little, so I didn’t call a lawyer.
Did you report the issue to the police?
No, we didn’t want to get the police involved.
Were you sent to the hospital after the accident?
No, the injury wasn’t really serious.
Do you have a driving license?

Sarah:  That meeting was a waste of time.
Brian:  I agree.  We didn't get anything done.
Sarah:  Sylvia was against everything.
Brian:  She wouldn't listen to anyone's ideas.
Sarah:  How can the boss handle her negative personality?
Brian:  They're good friends.
Sarah:  How can Sylvia have any friends?  She is so pessimistic about everything.
Brian:  I know.  All she does is complain all day.
Sarah:  Should we talk to Jim?
Brian:  That's not going to do anything.  Jim is a naysayer too.

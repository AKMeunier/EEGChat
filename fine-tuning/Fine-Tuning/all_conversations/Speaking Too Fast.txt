Raul:  Are you ready for the English test tomorrow?
June:  No.  I am going to fail it.
Raul:  Didn't you study and take notes?
June:  My notes will not help me.
Raul:  Why?
June:  The teacher speaks too fast.  I couldn't write anything down.
Raul:  Why didn't you ask her to speak slowly?
June:  I was too embarrassed to tell her I didn't understand.  
Raul:  I'll help you study.  I have a lot of notes.

HELEN: "Hi Joan. Where are you going?"
JOAN: "Hi Helen. I'm taking my grandchildren to a butterfly conservatory today."
HELEN: "What is that?"
JOAN: "It's a place that displays butterflies and you can learn all about them."
HELEN: "So, it's like a museum for butterflies?"
JOAN: "Yes, but these butterflies are alive."
HELEN: "They're alive?"
JOAN: "Yes, they fly around the room and sometimes they even land on you. A butterfly landed on my head once."
HELEN: "That's so fun!"
JOAN: "It is. There are so many different kinds of butterflies too. They're so beautiful. Their colors and designs are spectacular."
HELEN: "Your grandkids are going to enjoy it."
JOAN: "I hope so."
HELEN: "If I were a child, I would enjoy it."
JOAN: "But times have changed. Kids prefer to watch television and play video games these days."
HELEN: "I understand. How old are your grandchildren?"
JOAN: "My granddaughter is 5 years old and my grandson is 7 years old."
HELEN: "I think they're both at a good age to enjoy it."
JOAN: "My granddaughter likes to draws butterflies and my grandson loves insects. So, I thought they would love this."
HELEN: "I think they will. Don't worry about it so much. Just go and have a good time."
JOAN: "Ok. I better go now."
HELEN: "Have fun!"

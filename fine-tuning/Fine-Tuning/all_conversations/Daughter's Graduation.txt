JANE: "Hi Kate. Our daughter is graduating from college this week."
KATE: "That's wonderful, Jane! What did she study?"
JANE: "Nursing."
KATE: "That's a great field. My mom was a nurse."
JANE: "My mother was a nurse too."
KATE: "She must be so proud of her."
JANE: "Yeah, she is. We are all proud of her."
KATE: "Does she want to work in a hospital?"
JANE: "Yeah. She got a job at the hospital already."
KATE: "That's great!"
JANE: "Are you doing anything special to celebrate?"
KATE: "We bought her a new car."
JANE: "Wow! That's an awesome gift!"
KATE: "I know. Her current car is so old. We want her to have a reliable car since she will be working late hours."
JANE: "That's smart."
KATE: "When does she start working?"
JANE: "In a month."
KATE: "What is she going to do for a month?"
JANE: "She's going backpacking with a friend in Europe."
KATE: "How fun! She's an adult now."
JANE: "I know. Kids grow up too fast."

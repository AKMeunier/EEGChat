Erin:  Do you want to go to the concert tonight?
Carol:  Do you have tickets?  
Erin:  Yes!  I got two tickets from my boss.  She can't go.
Carol:  I would love to go, but what about Cindy?
Erin:   I only have two tickets.
Carol:  What if she finds out?  She'll be so sad.
Erin:  I can't give up these tickets.  They're front row seats!
Carol:  Front row!  Let's tell Cindy that we have to work late.
Erin:  Don't you want to buy a concert T-shirt?
Carol:  Then she'll know we went to the concert.
Erin:  We'll get her one and tell her that my boss got them for us.
Carol:  Ok.  That's a good lie.

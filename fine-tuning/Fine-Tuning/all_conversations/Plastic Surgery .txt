Is plastic surgery popular in your country?
Not really. People in my country are not so interested in plastic surgery.
What do you think about people having plastic surgery?
It’s hard to say. As long as they find happiness in what they’re doing, it’s fine with me.
Why do you think people do it?
They want to gain a better look, I believe. That’s understandable.
Is plastic surgery bad?
It’s bad for health in the long run.
Does it do harm to your health?
Sure, there are several unhealthy substances in the medical treatments which may be harmful to your body.
Do you think changing your look is a good thing?
Yes, I can’t deny that changing for a better appearance is what people should do. But don’t abuse plastic surgery or you will face serious health problems later on.
Do you think the development of plastic surgery is a positive or negative trend?
It’s more a positive trend, I guess. Thanks to plastic surgery, people who think they don’t look good can now make themselves more attractive.
Do you care more about your outlook or inner soul?
As for me, the inner soul does matter more although outside appearance is important, too.
What is a part of your face that you wish to change?
Although I have some imperfect parts, I have no wish to change anything. I love the natural appearance my parents gave me.

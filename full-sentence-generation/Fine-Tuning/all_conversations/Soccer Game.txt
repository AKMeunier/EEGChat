DAVID: "Did you watch the soccer game yesterday?"
CATHY: "Yeah, I watched it at the arena."
DAVID: "You went to the game?"
CATHY: "Yeah, I went with my co-workers."
DAVID: "It was a good game to watch. It was really close."
CATHY: "I know. We were all screaming. The crowd was out of control."
DAVID: "Were people getting angry?"
CATHY: "Yeah. It was getting a little scary. The security guards came and escorted someone out of the arena."
DAVID: "Why?"
CATHY: "He got really drunk and was cursing at everyone."
DAVID: "That's crazy! People like that always ruin the fun for everyone."
CATHY: "I agree. He was out of control. He threw beer on a stranger."
DAVID: "Wow!"
CATHY: "The stranger stayed calm. But it was a good thing security came."
DAVID: "I would've been so upset."
CATHY: "Yeah, everyone was getting really upset at the drunk guy. That's why security was called."
DAVID: "Sounds like it was an interesting game."
CATHY: "It really was. I don't know if I want to go to another game for a while."
DAVID: "At least our team won."

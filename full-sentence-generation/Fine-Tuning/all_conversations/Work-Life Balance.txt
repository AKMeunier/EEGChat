Lisa:  How do you balance your work life and your personal life?
Mary:  I don't bring my work home.
Lisa:  What do you mean?
Mary:  Don't do more than you can handle.  
Lisa:  What if you have a lot of work to do?
Mary:  Then I stay at the office and finish it.  When I go home, I focus on home only.
Lisa:  I wish I was like you.

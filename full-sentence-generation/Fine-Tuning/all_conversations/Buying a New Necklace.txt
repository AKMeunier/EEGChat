SUSIE: "Hi Sally. What are you doing here?"
SALLY: "Hey Susie. I need to buy my sister a new necklace. I accidentally lost her necklace and she is really mad at me now."
SUSIE: "But you said it was an accident."
SALLY: "Yeah, but I didn't ask if I could borrow it."
SUSIE: "Oh, that's not good."
SALLY: "She wasn't home and it looked nice with my outfit, so I wore it."
SUSIE: "That's like stealing."
SALLY: "I know. I feel terrible. I was going to put it back when I got home."
SUSIE: "How did you lose it?"
SALLY: "I don't know. I was on my way home and I noticed it was gone."
SUSIE: "Was it an expensive necklace?"
SALLY: "I don't know. I'm looking for a replacement here."
SUSIE: "What does it look like?"
SALLY: "It's a gold butterfly."
SUSIE: "Like this one?"
SALLY: "That's it! That's exactly like hers? How much is it?"
SUSIE: "The price tag says $100."
SALLY: "Wow! That's expensive. Now I see why she was really mad."
SUSIE: "Are you going to buy it?"
SALLY: "Yeah. That's all the money I have until my next paycheck."

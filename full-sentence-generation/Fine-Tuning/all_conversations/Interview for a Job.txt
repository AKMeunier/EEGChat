SALLY: "Why are you so dressed up, Jane?"
JANE: "Oh, hi Sally. I have a job interview today."
SALLY: "That's great. Where?"
JANE: "At the bank. I'm applying for a teller position."
SALLY: "But why do you look so nervous?"
JANE: "Because I don't have much work experience, but I'm a hard worker and good with numbers."
SALLY: "Tell them that."
JANE: "I'm going to. I just hope I don't mess up."
SALLY: "Don't worry so much. You're smart and you get along well with everyone."
JANE: "Thanks. I'm just afraid that I won't be able to answer their questions."
SALLY: "Just answer them the best you can. Be confident."
JANE: "Ok. I just need to relax."
SALLY: "What time is your interview?"
JANE: "In an hour. I better leave soon. I don't want to be late."
SALLY: "Yeah, don't be late. That would be a bad first impression."
JANE: "You're right. Thanks for your advice and encouragement. I feel much better."
SALLY: "Good. Now go!"

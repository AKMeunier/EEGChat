HELEN: "Hi Carol. Why do you look so excited?"
CAROL: "Hi Helen. Stan and I are taking a trip to the Bahamas."
HELEN: "That's wonderful. Is it a special occasion?"
CAROL: "It's was our anniversary yesterday."
HELEN: "Happy Anniversary! How many years have you been married?"
CAROL: "30 years."
HELEN: "That's wonderful."
CAROL: "Thanks. We've been planning this trip for years. But he surprised me with the tickets last night."
HELEN: "That's so sweet. When do you leave?"
CAROL: "We're leaving in a couple of weeks. I can't wait. This is the best anniversary present."
HELEN: "Are you and Stan free tonight?"
CAROL: "Yes. Why?"
HELEN: "Would you like to come over? I'd like to make you both dinner since I missed your anniversary yesterday."
CAROL: "Sure. That's so kind of you."
HELEN: "Come around 7 pm. Bob will be home by then."
CAROL: "Thanks! What can I bring tonight?"
HELEN: "How about some sun after you get back from the Bahamas? It's so cold here these days."
CAROL: "I wish I could."

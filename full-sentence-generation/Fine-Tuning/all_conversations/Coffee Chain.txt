Gary:  I feel like drinking some coffee.
Amy:  That sounds good.  Where do you want to go?
Gary:  Let's go to Starbucks.
Amy:  I don't want to go to Starbucks.
Gary:  Why not?  They have delicious coffee.
Amy:  That's true, but it is overpriced and I like to support small businesses.
Gary:  Fine.  But next time we are going to Starbucks.
Amy:  Fair enough.

SANDY: "Hi Janice. Why do you look so nervous?"
JANICE: "Oh, hi Sandy. Bill and I are going out to dinner without the kids."
SANDY: "That sounds fun! So, why do you look nervous?"
JANICE: "We hired a babysitter. This will be our first time leaving the kids with a babysitter."
SANDY: "Really? Who did you hire?"
JANICE: "Our friend's daughter, Natalie. She is 18 years old."
SANDY: "Natalie? Carol's daughter?"
JANICE: "Yes. Do you know her?"
SANDY: "Yeah. She used to babysit my children a couple of years ago."
JANICE: "Did you like her as a babysitter?"
SANDY: "Yes. She was a very responsible girl."
JANICE: "That's great to hear."
SANDY: "You can trust her. She babysits for a few people I know."
JANICE: "Yeah, I heard she has a lot of babysitting experience."
SANDY: "She loves children. She wants to go to medical school and become a pediatric doctor."
JANICE: "Wow! She must be a smart girl."
SANDY: "She is. She was a straight A student in high school and she has been accepted to many colleges."
JANICE: "That's awesome!"
SANDY: "She's babysitting a lot to save money for college tuition."
JANICE: "Now I feel a lot better about hiring her as a babysitter."

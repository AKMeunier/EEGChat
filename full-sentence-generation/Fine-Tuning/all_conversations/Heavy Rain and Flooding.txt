TIM: "Joe, where are you going in such a hurry?"
JOE: "Didn't you hear? The weather report is predicting heavy rain and severe flooding in our area."
TIM: "No, I didn't hear that. I haven't watched the news in a few days."
JOE: "I'm heading to the store to buy sandbags."
TIM: "Sandbags? Why?"
JOE: "To stop the water from entering my house. You should do the same thing."
TIM: "I think I'll just evacuate if that happens."
JOE: "I can't do that. I need to stay here with all of my animals."
TIM: "You don't have any place to take them?"
JOE: "No. I need to make sure they are safe."
TIM: "Do you need help loading the sandbags into your truck?"
JOE: "That would be great. Aren't you worried at all?"
TIM: "I guess I should be. But every time the weather person says something terrible is going to happen, it never does."
JOE: "Well, I'm not risking it this time."
TIM: "Now you have me worried."
JOE: "You should be."

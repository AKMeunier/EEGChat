Claire:  Do you like my new bag?
Katie:  It's nice.  When did you get it?
Claire:  Today.  I got it on sale.
Katie:  That's a designer bag.  
Claire:  I know.  It's a one-day sale.  You should check it out.
Katie:  I think I will.  I need a new bag.
Claire:  Can I join you?
Katie:  Sure.  But you already bought a new bag.
Claire:  I think I'll get one for my mom too.
Katie:  Let's hurry before everything is sold out.

CAROL: "Hi Anne. What are you doing?"
ANNE: "Hi Carol. I'm planning a birthday party for Tim."
CAROL: "How is that going?"
ANNE: "Not well. I can't think of anything to do."
CAROL: "How many kids do you want to invite?"
ANNE: "He wants to invite all of the boys in his classroom. That's 12 boys."
CAROL: "No girls?"
ANNE: "He doesn't want to invite any girls."
CAROL: "How about an outdoor party?"
ANNE: "We did that last year and it rained."
CAROL: "Oh. That's not fun."
ANNE: "I was thinking about taking the kids to a pizza place."
CAROL: "Kids like pizza. How about taking them to a movie theater, too?"
ANNE: "That's too expensive."
CAROL: "Yeah. How about renting a movie and watching it at home after the pizza place?"
ANNE: "I love that idea! Then they can play in our backyard if it doesn't rain."
CAROL: "That sounds like a great party."
ANNE: "Thanks for your help."

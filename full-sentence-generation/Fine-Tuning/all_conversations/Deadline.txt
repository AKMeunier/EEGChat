Daniel:  Are you done with your part of the presentation?
Greg:  No, not yet.
Daniel:  Tomorrow is the deadline.
Greg:  I've been busy.  I'll finish it tonight.
Daniel:  Your co-workers always have to do your work.
Greg:  I'm sorry.  I just work slowly.
Daniel:  You just don't care.  You never help the team.
Greg:  What do you want me to do?
Daniel:  Do you share of the work!

MOM: "Hey Jane. Did you eat lunch?"
JANE: "No, I don't have time. I have a big test today at 1 pm."
MOM: "You still need to eat or you won't have energy for the test."
JANE: "I know. I'll grab something on the way to class."
MOM: "Fast food?"
JANE: "Yeah, I'll grab a burger."
MOM: "That's not healthy for you. Let me make you something to eat."
JANE: "Thanks. But I don't have time."
MOM: "You never have the time to eat a proper meal anymore."
JANE: "I like fast food meals anyway. They're quick and easy."
MOM: "Let me pack you some fruits."
JANE: "Mom, please. I'm in college now. I can cut my own fruits."
MOM: "But you won't do it."
JANE: "I'll take this banana. It's quick and easy. See you later, Mom."
MOM: "Eat something nutritious!"

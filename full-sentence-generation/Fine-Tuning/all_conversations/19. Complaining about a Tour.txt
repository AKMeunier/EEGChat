B: Hello.
A: I want to make a complaint about the all-day bus tour I took yesterday.
B: I'm sorry you have a complaint.
A: I actually have a few complaints.
B: Please tell me what went wrong.
A: We were stuck in traffic for an hour.
B: Well, that's out of our control.
A: The bus had no air conditioning.
B: It was 60 degrees out yesterday though.
A: I want a full refund.
B: I can't give you a full refund since you enjoyed part of the tour.
A: How about a partial refund then?
B: I will give you a partial refund for the unsatisfactory tour.

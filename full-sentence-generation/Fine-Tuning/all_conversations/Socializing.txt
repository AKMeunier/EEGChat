James:  Are you ready for the business trip?
Paul:  Yeah.  I'm a little nervous.
James:  Is this your first business trip?
Paul:  No.  I just don't know any of these people.  Do you have any advice for me?
James:  Just socialize.  Get to know them.  Go out for drinks one night.
Paul:  Actually, two of our clients are taking me out for drinks the first night.
James:  That's good.  Don't stress about it so much.
Paul:  I want to make a good first impression.
James:  Then don't get drunk.
Paul:  What if I get nervous and drink too much.
James:  Then you'll have more things to worry about.

JIM: "What's wrong, Ted."
TED: "Hey Jim. My family and I planned a trip to Hawaii and I'm not sure I can go now."
JIM: "Why?"
TED: "I'm so busy at work. I have too many things to do."
JIM: "What do you have to do?"
TED: "I have a big presentation due soon."
JIM: "What are you going to do?"
TED: "I don't know. The airline tickets are non-refundable and my family is going to be very sad."
JIM: "Is there any way you can finish everything before your trip?"
TED: "That's what I'm trying to do, but I don't know if I can."
JIM: "Is there anyone at work who can help you?"
TED: "Yeah, but he's been sick."
JIM: "Oh. That's terrible. Why don't you talk to your boss?"
TED: "He's not very understanding. He just wants the work to be completed."
JIM: "Maybe you can take work with you on your trip."
TED: "That's not a vacation. But I may have to do that. My wife is not going to be happy."
JIM: "I wish I could help you."
TED: "Thanks. Do you know anything about presentations?"
JIM: "No, I'm an accountant."

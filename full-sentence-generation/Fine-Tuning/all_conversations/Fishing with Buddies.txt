JAMES: "Hey Phil, I'm so glad it's Friday."
PHIL: "I agree, James. It was a stressful work week."
JAMES: "Have any fun plans this weekend?"
PHIL: "Yeah, I'm going fishing with my buddies."
JAMES: "Lucky!"
PHIL: "Do you want to join us?"
JAMES: "I can't. I'm helping my brother move. He recently bought a house."
PHIL: "That's too bad. We're going to have beautiful weather too."
JAMES: "I'm glad we're going to have good weather. I don't want to move boxes and furniture in the rain."
PHIL: "That's true. When are you going to be done?"
JAMES: "I don't know. He has a lot of stuff. It could be all day."
PHIL: "Well, if you get done early, why don't you meet us at the lake?"
JAMES: "Are you going out on a boat?"
PHIL: "No, we're going to fish on the lake shore. None of us have a boat."
JAMES: "My brother has a boat. I can ask him if we can borrow it sometime."
PHIL: "That would be awesome! Thanks!"
JAMES: "Well, I'm going to head home now. I'm tired."
PHIL: "Yeah. Me too. Call me this weekend if you get done early."

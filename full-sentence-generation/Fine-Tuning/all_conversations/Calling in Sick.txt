Jessica:  Where is Carol?
May:  She's not coming to work today.  She's sick.
Jessica:  Again?  
May:  Yeah.  She called in sick a few minutes ago.
Jessica:  That's strange.
May:  What's strange?
Jessica:  I saw her get into a taxi this morning.  She was carrying luggage.
May:  Do you think she was going on a trip?
Jessica:  It looked like it.  Doesn't she always call in sick on Fridays?
May:  Yeah, you're right!

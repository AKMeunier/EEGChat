Yes, definitely, because you can watch vivid images on a large screen with lively sound effects.

I often go to the movie theater every weekend.
What’s your favorite type of movie? What movie of that type do you like?

Was that movie adapted from a book?
No, the story is derived from funny situations in real life.

Mr. Bean is the main character, he is played by Rowan Atkinson who is from England.

It was recommended by my classmate.

It was in English, but I can also watch it with subtitles.

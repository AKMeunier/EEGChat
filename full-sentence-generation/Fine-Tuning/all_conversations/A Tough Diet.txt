Rachael:  How's your diet going?
Monica:  Not well.  
Rachael:  What's wrong?
Monica:  I can't eat sugar but, I love things with sugar.
Rachael:  So, you're on the no-sugar diet?
Monica:  Yeah.  It's torture.
Rachael:  I tried that once.  It was hard.
Monica:  How did you lose weight last year?
Rachael:  I did the no-fat diet and exercise.
Monica:  What is a no-fat diet?
Rachael:  You can't eat things like fried foods, butter, or ice cream.
Monica:  That sounds worse than the no-sugar diet.
Rachael:  It is worse.  But, it works.

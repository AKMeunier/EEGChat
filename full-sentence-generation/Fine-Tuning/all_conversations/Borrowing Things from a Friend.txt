MIKE: "Hello?"
DAN: "Mike. This is Dan. Do you have a lantern I can borrow?"
MIKE: "I think so. I have to check."
DAN: "Our lantern is broken."
MIKE: "What do you need a lantern for?"
DAN: "We are going camping this weekend."
MIKE: "We went camping last month."
DAN: "How was the weather last month?"
MIKE: "It was great! Sunny all weekend."
DAN: "I think it is going to rain this weekend."
MIKE: "That's not good. Why are you going camping if it's going to rain?"
DAN: "The kids still want to go."
MIKE: "I'm sure you will still have fun."
DAN: "I hope so. We're going to pack some extra clothes."
MIKE: "Let me check on that lantern."
DAN: "Mike."
MIKE: "What's wrong, Dan?"
DAN: "Do you have a tent I can borrow?"
MIKE: "Sure. Why?"
DAN: "I just discovered a hole in our tent."

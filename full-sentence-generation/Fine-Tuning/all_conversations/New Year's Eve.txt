SALLY: "Good morning, Sue."
SUE: "Good morning, Sally."
SALLY: "How did you spend your New Year's Eve?"
SUE: "I did the countdown to New Year's with my family. How about you?"
SALLY: "I worked until 9 pm and met some friends afterwards."
SUE: "You had to work on New Year's Eve?"
SALLY: "Yeah. I stayed up until midnight to wish everyone a 'Happy New Year.' Then I went home to sleep. I was so tired."
SUE: "Why are you up so early? Do you have to work today, too?"
SALLY: "No. I'm going to my parents' house. I'm going to watch the Rose Bowl on TV with my dad. It's our annual tradition."
SUE: "What is the Rose Bowl?"
SALLY: "You've never heard of the Rose Bowl? It's a big American college football game. It's played every January 1."
SUE: "We don't watch that much football in our house."
SALLY: "Have you ever watched the Tournament of Roses parade?"
SUE: "No. What is that?"
SALLY: "It's a big parade that is shown before the football game. It's America's New Year celebration."
SUE: "That must be fun."
SALLY: "You should watch it. It's an annual American tradition."
SUE: "I think I will."
SALLY: "Well, I better go now. Happy New Year, Sue!"
SUE: "Happy New Year, Sally!"

What school did you go to?
I went to Millennium high school, founded in 1999.
Where is the school located?
It’s located in New York City, United States.
Do you like the architecture of the school?
Yes, I do. The architecture is not really impressive, but I like it that the building’s architects left plenty of space for lounging.

Most of the teachers there are helpful and friendly. I especially like Mr. Mike, my Physics teacher.
How long have you spent there?

Do you like the school uniform?
We don’t wear uniforms at school, actually.
Why do you enjoy the time there?
Although I had to deal with quite a heavy workload, I enjoy the relaxing atmosphere when hanging out with friends in the cafeteria there.
What important lesson did you learn from school?
I learned how to work in a group in which there are many friends coming from different cultures. That’s the lesson of cooperation.
Will you recommend that school to others?
Yes, of course. I’m proud to recommend Millennium High School to anyone who is searching for a good place to learn.

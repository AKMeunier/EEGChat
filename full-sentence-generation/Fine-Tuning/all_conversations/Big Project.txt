PETER: "Hey Tom. Are you working late again?"
TOM: "Yeah, Peter. I have a big project I'm working on."
PETER: "How's it going?"
TOM: "Not well. We keep running into problems with the client."
PETER: "What kind of problems."
TOM: "The client either doesn't like our designs or keeps changing his mind. It's very frustrating."
PETER: "That can be very annoying."
TOM: "It is. So, my group has to start over each time. It's such a waste of time and money."
PETER: "When is the deadline?"
TOM: "In two weeks. I don't know how we're going to make it."
PETER: "Where's the rest of your group?"
TOM: "They went to eat. I told them to go. They're going to bring me back some dinner."
PETER: "That's good. What are you going to do after your deadline is over?"
TOM: "Go on a long vacation."
PETER: "Good for you!"
TOM: "Well, I better get back to work. See you in the morning."

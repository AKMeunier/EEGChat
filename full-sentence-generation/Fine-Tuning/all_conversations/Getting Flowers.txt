CATHY: "Who are the beautiful flowers from?"
SUSAN: "They're from my boyfriend."
CATHY: "That's so sweet! Those are long-stemmed roses."
SUSAN: "I know. They're beautiful."
CATHY: "How many are there?"
SUSAN: "I counted 30."
CATHY: "Wow! That must've been expensive."
SUSAN: "I need to find a vase. I don't want them to die."
CATHY: "Is there one in the kitchen?"
SUSAN: "I found one. But it's too small."
CATHY: "Yeah, that bouquet is huge. You're a lucky woman. I wish my boyfriend would send me flowers. Is it a special occasion?"
SUSAN: "No, not really."
CATHY: "Do you know why he sent them?"
SUSAN: "I have an idea."
CATHY: "Why do you think he sent them?"
SUSAN: "Well, he forgot my birthday yesterday."
CATHY: "Oh! Now, I understand."

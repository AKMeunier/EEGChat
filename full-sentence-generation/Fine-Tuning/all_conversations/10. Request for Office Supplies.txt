A: Hey Alice, do you have a stapler I can use?
B: Of course I do. It's on my desk.
A: Thanks. Mine broke two weeks ago.
B: Didn't you put in a office supply request?
A: I asked Joseph if he would get me one.
B: I know he's in charge, but you should submit a form.
A: A form? What form?
B: An Office Supply form. Don't rely on Joseph. Put it in writing.
A: Oh, I could use a couple of other supplies, too.
B: Yes, by all means, get what you need.
A: Where are these forms?
B: I'll email it to you. Just print it, and send it in.
A: Thanks, Alice.
B: No problem.

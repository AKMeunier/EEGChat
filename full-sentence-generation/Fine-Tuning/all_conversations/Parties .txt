On what occasions do people in your country celebrate parties?
There are many occasions when people throw parties such as New Year’s eve, wedding engagments, family reunions, birthdays, etc, but sometimes people hold parties just when they meet up and want to have something fun to do.
Are you a party animal?
Yes, I am. I’m crazy about going to parties. I love meeting friends, drinking, and talking.
When do parties often start and finish?
It depends on what kind of party it is. I believe the perfect time to have a party is in the evening, from 8-11 pm.
Where are the parties thrown?
They are held inside or outside. Some formal events like weddings/housewarmings are organized inside while others like family reunions and birthdays may be held outside.
What do you usually wear when you come to a party?
I often wear casual clothes like a T-shirt and jeans if I go to informal parties, and a dress for formal ones.
What do people do in the parties you attended?
At the party, people talk, eat and drink together. Some go there to find business opportunities and new partners.
Do you enjoy drinking alcohol at the parties?
Yes, a little beer can cheer me up.
Do people have to bring anything to the party?
It’s not required, but sometimes visitors bring some gifts to show their love for the host.
Why do people, especially the youth, love going to parties?
It’s just a good way for them to chill out after a long day.

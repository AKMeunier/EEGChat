NANCY: "Jennifer, are you going to join the Choir Club?"
JENNIFER: "No, Nancy. I'm not."
NANCY: "Why? You have such a beautiful voice."
JENNIFER: "I'm too shy."
NANCY: "You sing so well. You could probably get a solo."
JENNIFER: "Thanks for the compliment. I'm scared to sing in front of an audience."
NANCY: "You're wasting your talent. If I could sing like you, I would join the Choir."
JENNIFER: "My mom said the same thing."
NANCY: "You should think about it again."
JENNIFER: "What if I get on stage and I freeze."
NANCY: "Maybe this is great way to overcome your fear."
JENNIFER: "I do love singing."
NANCY: "Then you should join. You'll make a great addition to the club."
JENNIFER: "Ok. Let me think about it."
NANCY: "The choir teacher thinks you should join."
JENNIFER: "How does she know? She never heard me sing."
NANCY: "Yes, she has. I recorded your singing and let her listen to it."
JENNIFER: "You did? Did she like it?"
NANCY: "She loved it! She said you have an amazing voice."

A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
B: Yes it is, may I ask who is calling?
A: This is your bank calling in regards to an overcharge on your credit card.
B: I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
A: It says here that you charged over $500 on it yesterday.
B: That can't be right; I have not used it in months!
A: Are you saying you did not make that charge?
B: That's exactly what I am saying.
A: Looking closer, this charge was made in a different city.
B: I am looking for my card now and I cannot find it.
A: This calls for further investigation.
B: I assure you I did not make the purchase.

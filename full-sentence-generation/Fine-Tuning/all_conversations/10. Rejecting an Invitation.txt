A: Were you invited to Barb's birthday party?
B: I was. It should be really fun.
A: Do you have a date for the party?
B: As a matter of fact I don't have.
A: Do you want to have a date for the party?
B: Do you know someone?
A: I was thinking maybe you'd want to go as my date.
B: Oh. I don't think that's a good idea.
A: Why not? You said yourself it would be fun.
B: The party would be fun. Going with you would not be.
A: Wow, that's kind of harsh.
B: At least I'm honest.

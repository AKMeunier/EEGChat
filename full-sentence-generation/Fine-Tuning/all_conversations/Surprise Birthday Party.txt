DIANE: "Hello?"
HELEN: "Hi Diane. This is Helen."
DIANE: "Hi Helen. What's up?"
HELEN: "I want to throw Mom a surprise birthday party."
DIANE: "That's wonderful idea. How can I help?"
HELEN: "Do you know who we should invite?"
DIANE: "Her friends and co-workers?"
HELEN: "Do you have their phone numbers or e-mail addresses?"
DIANE: "No, I don't. Why don't we ask Dad? He should have them."
HELEN: "Do you think Dad can keep a secret?"
DIANE: "Yeah. Remember he surprised her with a trip to France a couple of years ago?"
HELEN: "Oh yeah. Mom was so surprised."
DIANE: "What kind of food should we serve?"
HELEN: "Let's serve Mom's favorite food, pasta. I can cook."
DIANE: "Ok. I can take care of the party decorations."
HELEN: "Perfect. Should we get together to discuss all of the plans?"
DIANE: "Sure. Do you want to meet right now?"
HELEN: "No. I have some things to do. Can I meet you at 5 pm?"
DIANE: "Ok. That sounds good."
HELEN: "Why don't you come to my house? I can make us dinner."

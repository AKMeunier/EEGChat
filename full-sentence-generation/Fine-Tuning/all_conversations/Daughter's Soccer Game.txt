CAROL: "Hi Janet. What are you doing today?"
JANET: "Hi Carol. My daughter has a soccer game at 11 am."
CAROL: "Today? It's going to rain all day."
JANET: "Yeah. She plays in the rain too."
CAROL: "They don't cancel games if it rains?"
JANET: "No, only if there's a storm."
CAROL: "Wow! But, I bet it's fun to watch."
JANET: "Yes. We love it. She's the goalie. She's really good."
CAROL: "How long has she been playing?"
JANET: "Seven years. She wants to get a scholarship to college."
CAROL: "She's a smart girl! Did you play soccer, too?"
JANET: "I played a couple of years in high school, but she is much better than I was."
CAROL: "Do you worry that she could get hurt?"
JANET: "Yes. All the time. But she loves the sport and wants to play."
CAROL: "Maybe we'll see her in the Olympics one day."
JANET: "That's her dream."

I’m quite impressed with the advertisement about Surf – a laundry detergent made by Unilever.

I accidentally saw it on TV 2 years ago.
What happened in the advertisement?
The ad told a story of a family in which the children all loved their step-mother due to the white shirts she prepared for them.
Why do you like it?
I just can’t stop loving the story in the ad. It’s such a sweet story.
Was there any famous actor/ actress in the advertisement?
Not at all. The actors were not very well-known, I think.
Did it attract much attention?
I have no idea, but I saw it in many public places.
What do you like the most in the advertisement?
Well, the vivid images and sound effects did attract me.
Do you believe in advertisements?
Not really. Ads always say good things and neglect to mention bad things about a product for obvious reasons.
How have advertisements changed recently?
They’re more modern. Digital marketing has proved successful in many fields.

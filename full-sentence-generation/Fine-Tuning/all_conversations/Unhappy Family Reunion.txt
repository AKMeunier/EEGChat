JANE: "Hello?"
SUSAN: "Hi Jane. This is Susan."
JANE: "Hi Susan. How are you?"
SUSAN: "Did you receive an invitation to the family reunion?"
JANE: "Yeah."
SUSAN: "Are you going to go?"
JANE: "I don't think so."
SUSAN: "Why?"
JANE: "Remember our cousin Bill and I had a disagreement at the last reunion?"
SUSAN: "Yes. But it was all a misunderstanding."
JANE: "I know, but I still feel uncomfortable about it."
SUSAN: "I would really like to see you there. I haven't seen you in a while."
JANE: "I know. I feel the same way."
SUSAN: "If you don't go to the reunion, maybe I can visit you."
JANE: "That sounds like a great idea. Have you ever been to New York?"
SUSAN: "No. I would love to visit you and check out the city."
JANE: "Let's plan to do that."
SUSAN: "I still want you to come to the reunion."
JANE: "I'll think about it."
SUSAN: "Ok. I hope to see you there."

A: Can I pay it off online?
B: Yes, you can. Look at the fine. It should give a website.
A: Oh, okay. Let me go get the ticket. It's in my car.
B: Hurry, because I need to leave to work.
A: Oh, wait. I forgot I put it in my wallet.
B: Well, take it out. Look in the back. It should give you a website.

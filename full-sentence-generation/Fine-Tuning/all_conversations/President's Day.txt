SUE: "Hi Alice. Do the kids go to school next Monday?"
ALICE: "Hi Sue. No, they don't. It's President's Day."
SUE: "What is President's Day?"
ALICE: "It's an American holiday. It's a day where we honor the United States former presidents."
SUE: "All of the former presidents?"
ALICE: "We used to celebrate our first president, George Washington's birthday and our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln's birthday."
SUE: "Were they both born in February?"
ALICE: "Yes. But in the 1970's, a law was passed that all presidents would be honored on one day in February. It became a national holiday."
SUE: "Is it celebrated on the same day each year?"
ALICE: "We celebrate it on the third Monday in February."
SUE: "Are businesses closed, too?"
ALICE: "Some businesses like post offices and banks will be closed. But not all businesses close."
SUE: "Do all schools close?"
ALICE: "Yes, typically they do."
SUE: "Thanks for the information. How do you know so much about President's Day?"
ALICE: "I used to be a history teacher."

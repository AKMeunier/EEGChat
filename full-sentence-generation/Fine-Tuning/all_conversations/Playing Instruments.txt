MATT: "Hey Jason, do you play any instruments?"
JASON: "Yeah, I play two instruments. I play the piano and violin?"
MATT: "I wish I knew how to play an instrument."
JASON: "You don't know how to play any instruments?"
MATT: "No. My mom gave me piano lessons when I was a child, but I hated it. So, I quit."
JASON: "I took piano and violin lessons when I was a child."
MATT: "How long did you take lessons?"
JASON: "10 years."
MATT: "Wow! You must be really good."
JASON: "My mom wanted me to go to a music college, but I wanted to be a doctor."
MATT: "Really?"
JASON: "Yeah. My mom was a famous violinist in China. My dad was a famous pianist in China."
MATT: "You come from a very talented family."
JASON: "Thanks. What instrument do you want to learn?"
MATT: "Guitar."
JASON: "Oh, I don't know how to play the guitar."
MATT: "We can take lessons together."
JASON: "I wish I could, but I don't have time."

STAN: "What happened, Mark?"
MARK: "A tree fell during the windstorm and hit my house."
STAN: "Wow! Is everyone ok?"
MARK: "Yes. Luckily, we weren't home at the time."
STAN: "Yes, you are very lucky!"
MARK: "I know. It was the big tree in our yard."
STAN: "I can't believe it. Will insurance cover the repair costs?"
MARK: "I hope so. I'm waiting for the insurance guy to come right now."
STAN: "What are you going to do? DO you have a place to stay while your house gets fixed?"
MARK: "Yeah, we're going to stay at my parents' house. They don't live far from here."
STAN: "That's good!"
MARK: "I really liked that tree. It was so big and beautiful. And, now it's in my living room."
STAN: "You're a strong man if you can joke about it."
MARK: "Well, if I don't laugh, I'll cry."
STAN: "I would be crying right now."
MARK: "Believe me, Stan. I am crying on the inside."

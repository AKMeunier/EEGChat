Erin:  Where should we go this summer?
Ryan:  Let's take a cruise.
Erin:  I'm afraid of the ocean.
Ryan:  Why?
Erin:  What if the ship sinks?
Ryan:  You shouldn't say that.  That's bad luck.
Erin:  Also, there are sharks in the ocean.
Ryan:  You won't be swimming in the ocean.
Erin:  If the ship sinks, we will.
Ryan:  You are being silly.  Let's just stay in a hotel with a pool.

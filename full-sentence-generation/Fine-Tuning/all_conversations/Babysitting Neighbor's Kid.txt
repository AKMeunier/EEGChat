TOM: "Hey Alison. Are you free for dinner tonight?"
ALISON: "Hi Tom. No, I'm not. I'm babysitting a neighbor's kid."
TOM: "What time?"
ALISON: "From 5 pm to 9 pm."
TOM: "What about next Friday?"
ALISON: "I'm babysitting again next Friday."
TOM: "Why are you babysitting so much?"
ALISON: "It's a good way to make money."
TOM: "Do you like children?"
ALISON: "Yeah, I love kids. They're fun to play with."
TOM: "I don't like them. They're noisy and they smell weird."
ALISON: "You're so funny. You would make a terrible babysitter."
TOM: "You're right. I'd rather babysit dogs."
ALISON: "Dogs are noisy and they smell weird too."
TOM: "I know. But they're cuter than kids."
ALISON: "You're silly."
TOM: "Then when are you free for dinner?"
ALISON: "Tomorrow night."
TOM: "OK. I'm free tomorrow too. I'll pick you up at 6 pm at your house."
ALISON: "Great! I'll see you then."

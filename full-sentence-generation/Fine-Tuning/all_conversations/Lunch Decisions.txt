KATHY: "Hey Bill, are you hungry?"
BILL: "Oh, hi Kathy. Yeah. Let's have lunch."
KATHY: "What do you want to eat?"
BILL: "How about pizza?"
KATHY: "We always have pizza. Let's try something different."
BILL: "Ok. Do you have any suggestions?"
KATHY: "How about sushi?"
BILL: "I don't like raw fish."
KATHY: "All sushi isn't raw."
BILL: "I know. I just don't feel like having sushi today."
KATHY: "Ok. Then what should we eat?"
BILL: "Maybe we should just order take-out. You get sushi and I'll get pizza."
KATHY: "That's a good idea. But I think I want Chinese food instead."
BILL: "Chinese food sounds yummy."
KATHY: "Hey, we agree on something. Let's go out to a Chinese restaurant."
BILL: "I'd rather eat at home."
KATHY: "We never agree on anything."

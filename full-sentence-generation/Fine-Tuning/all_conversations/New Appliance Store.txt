JOAN: "Hi Carol. There's a new appliance store opening downtown today. Have you seen the flyer for the grand opening?"
CAROL: "Hi Joan. Yeah, I was thinking about checking it out."
JOAN: "Do you want to go together?"
CAROL: "Sure. I don't need a new appliance, but I would love to update my washer and dryer one day."
JOAN: "I just bought a new washer and dryer set. I love it!"
CAROL: "I'm jealous. My set is really old. It takes a long time to wash and dry."
JOAN: "You should really look into upgrading your set. It can save you money?"
CAROL: "How can it save me money?"
JOAN: "The new washers use less water and the dryers uses less energy."
CAROL: "Really? Maybe it's time for an upgrade."
JOAN: "I can show you what I bought."
CAROL: "That would great! Maybe it will be on sale."
JOAN: "I wish I knew about the new store when I bought my set. I paid full price for mine."
CAROL: "You didn't buy it on sale?"
JOAN: "No, I was foolish."
CAROL: "I'm not jealous anymore."
JOAN: "Let's go check out the new store."

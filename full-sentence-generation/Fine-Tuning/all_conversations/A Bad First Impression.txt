Janice:  Did you meet a lot of people yesterday?
Gary:  Yes, but I don't think I made a good first impression.
Janice:  What happened?
Gary:  I was trying to act too cool.  I don't think they took me seriously.
Janice:  Did you give them your business card?
Gary:  I forgot them, so I wrote my contact info on napkins.
Janice:  Oh.  That's not very professional looking.
Gary:  I know.  What am I going to do?  
Janice:  Try to stay positive.  Send them your resume.  See what happens.
Gary:  Ok.  I'll attach a thank you note too.
Janice:  Good idea.

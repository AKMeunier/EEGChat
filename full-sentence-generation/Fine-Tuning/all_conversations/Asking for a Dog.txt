DANIEL: "Dad, can we get a dog?"
DAD: "Daniel, are we talking about this again?"
DANIEL: "You promised we could get one when I got older."
DAD: "Having a dog is a big responsibility."
DANIEL: "I know. I promise to help take care of it."
DAD: "You have to walk him, feed him, bathe him, clean his messes, and play with him."
DANIEL: "I promise to do all of those things."
DAD: "I need to talk to your mom first."
DANIEL: "But mom doesn't want a dog. She doesn't like them."
DAD: "It's because she is afraid of them."
DANIEL: "Why is she afraid of dogs?"
DAD: "She was bitten by a dog when she was a child."
DANIEL: "Oh, I see. But if we get a puppy, we can train it not to bite."
DAD: "That's true."
DANIEL: "Dad, did you have a dog when you were a kid?"
DAD: "Yes. But I was old enough to help take care of him."
DANIEL: "How old were you?"
DAD: "Ten years old."
DANIEL: "Dad, I'm eleven years old."

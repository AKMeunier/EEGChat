JOAN: "Hi Carol. I have some new tomatoes and cucumbers from my garden. Would you like some?"
CAROL: "I would love some, Joan. The tomatoes you gave me last time were delicious."
JOAN: "I know. I made spaghetti sauce with them. I'm growing more vegetables this year."
CAROL: "What are you growing?"
JOAN: "Zucchinis and lettuce."
CAROL: "That's amazing! You won't have to buy any more vegetables at the market."
JOAN: "I know. I'll let you know when the zucchinis and lettuce are ready."
CAROL: "Thank you. You're so generous."
JOAN: "Well, you always make me apple pies with apples from your apple tree."
CAROL: "I will make you more in exchange for the vegetables."
JOAN: "That's a deal!"
CAROL: "Have you thought about selling your vegetables at the local farmer's market?"
JOAN: "No. I like giving them to my family and friends."
CAROL: "That's nice of you."
JOAN: "I live alone, so I can't eat all of the vegetables by myself."

THOMAS: "How was the hotel?"
SAM: "It was awful. We had to switch rooms a couple of times."
THOMAS: "Why?"
SAM: "Well, we found bugs in the carpet in one room. We had already unpacked. So, we had to re-pack everything and ask for another room."
THOMAS: "What was wrong with the second room?"
SAM: "We paid for a garden room and it was a view of the parking lot."
THOMAS: "That's terrible. Did you finally get a good room?"
SAM: "They were out of garden view rooms, so they upgraded us to an ocean view room."
THOMAS: "That's nice! So, why was it so awful?"
SAM: "Our next door neighbor snored so loudly. He kept us awake every night."
THOMAS: "Did you ask for another room?"
SAM: "Yes, but they said that there were no more rooms available."
THOMAS: "I'm sorry you had a terrible time."
SAM: "That's ok. The manager was really nice about it. He offered us a free stay next time."
THOMAS: "Are you going to go back there?"
SAM: "Of course. It'll be free."

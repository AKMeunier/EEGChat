MARY: "Hi Sally. My kids want to go out for breakfast this weekend. Do you have a favorite restaurant?"
SALLY: "Hi Mary. Yeah, our favorite place is the pancake house on Main Street."
MARY: "Oh, I haven't been there yet."
SALLY: "We love it. Kids eat free on their birthdays too."
MARY: "What do your kids like there?"
SALLY: "They love the chocolate chip pancakes."
MARY: "Oh, my children would love those. They like anything with chocolate."
SALLY: "I like their waffles. They're thick and fluffy. They put fresh strawberries over them."
MARY: "I may want to try that. I'm getting hungry now."
SALLY: "Me too."
MARY: "Would you like to join us on Saturday morning?"
SALLY: "I can't on Saturday. Joanne has a soccer game in the morning. What about Sunday?"
MARY: "We have church in the morning, but we are free around 10 am."
SALLY: "10 am is good for us too."
MARY: "Ok. Let's meet on Sunday at 10 am at the restaurant."
SALLY: "That sounds wonderful."

A: Why do you have so many full trash bags?
B: I had a party last night. I'm cleaning up now and tossing them away.
A: Wait! What are you doing?
B: Throwing these bags into the trash can. Why do you seem concerned?
A: Did you divide the recyclables from the trash?
B: No, I didn't. I was a bit lazy to do so.
A: Don't be lazy. You should do your part in helping the environment.
B: You're right. It's going to be messy though. Mind giving me a hand?
A: Sure. I'd be glad to.
B: Thank you. This is a lot to handle alone.
A: Don't mention it. After all, one person can make a big difference to the environment.
B: I'll be sure to be more considerate next time.

SCOTT: "Hey Sam. What was your first job?"
SAM: "I worked at a fast food restaurant."
SCOTT: "Did you like it?"
SAM: "It was ok.  It was always busy."
SCOTT: "What did you do there?"
SAM: "I took orders at the counter and sometimes at the drive-thru window."
SCOTT: "Was it fun?"
SAM: "It wasn't fun. It was just a job. We had to work fast."
SCOTT: "I need to find a job. I was thinking about applying at a fast food restaurant."
SAM: "It's a good place to learn how to work quickly."
SCOTT: "I'm a fast learner and I can move pretty quickly."
SAM: "Also, it's a good place to learn how to handle customers."
SCOTT: "I don't have any customer service experience."
SAM: "They will train you. You just have to be polite and listen well."
SCOTT: "I can do that."
SAM: "You should apply then."
SCOTT: "Did you get to eat a lot of the food?"
SAM: "I ate too much fast food working there. I got sick of it."
SCOTT: "I love fast food. I may eat it every day."
SAM: "That's probably not a good thing."

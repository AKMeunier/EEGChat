CATHY: "Hi Joan. What is Amanda going to be for Halloween?"
JOAN: "Hi Cathy. She wants to be a ballerina. What about Sally?"
CATHY: "She can't decide between a bear and a lion."
JOAN: "That's cute. Are you going to make her costume?"
CATHY: "No, not this year. It's too much work. How about you?"
JOAN: "I'm lucky. Amanda took ballet lessons last month, so she can wear her ballet outfit."
CATHY: "That's smart."
JOAN: "Yeah. Costumes can be so expensive."
CATHY: "I know. That's why I made Sally's costume last year."
JOAN: "What was she last year? I can't remember."
CATHY: "A butterfly."
JOAN: "That's right. She was so cute."
CATHY: "Thanks. This year, she wants to be an animal."
JOAN: "That's not a bad idea. It's going to be cold outside. Her costume will keep her warm."
CATHY: "True! I better check out the costume store soon before everything is sold out."
JOAN: "Or you may have to make her costume again."

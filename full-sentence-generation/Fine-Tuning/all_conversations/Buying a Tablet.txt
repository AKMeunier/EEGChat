TOM: "Hey Mark. What are you doing today?"
MARK: "I'm going to the electronics store with my son."
TOM: "Are you buying a new TV?"
MARK: "No. My son has been saving money to buy a tablet. They're so expensive, so I told him I would pay for half of it."
TOM: "That's so nice of you."
MARK: "His birthday is next week, so this is his birthday present."
TOM: "Why don't you buy one for yourself?"
MARK: "I already have one. My son really likes it. So, he wants one of his own."
TOM: "Oh, I see. They're great. They're like mini computers. I love the touch screen feature."
MARK: "I know. My son keeps taking mine. I'm tired of sharing it with him all the time."
TOM: "Is that why you are helping him buy one?"
MARK: "Yes. Do you have one?"
TOM: "Yeah. I should get another one too."
MARK: "Why?"
TOM: "My daughter keeps taking mine. Let me know if there are any sales."

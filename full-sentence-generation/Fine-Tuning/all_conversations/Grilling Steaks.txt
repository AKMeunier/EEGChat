DAN: "Hi Tim. Do you want to grill some streaks tonight?"
TIM: "Hi Dan. Steaks sound delicious."
DAN: "They are on sale at the market."
TIM: "Should we invite some friends?"
DAN: "Ok. Who?"
TIM: "How about Sandy and Linda."
DAN: "Ok. But Linda is a vegetarian."
TIM: "What is a vegetarian?"
DAN: "A vegetarian is a person who does not eat meat."
TIM: "Oh. Maybe we should invite someone else."
DAN: "How about Susie?"
TIM: "Ok. Let's invite Sandy and Susie."
DAN: "I will go to the market and buy four steaks. What else should we eat?"
TIM: "How about potatoes and salad."
DAN: "Ok. I will go to the market now. Can you call Sandy and Susie?"
TIM: "Sure. Dan, why aren't you leaving? What's wrong?"
DAN: "It's raining. What should we do?"
TIM: "We can still barbeque. We have a covered backyard."
DAN: "Ok. I'll be back soon. I hope the weather gets better."
TIM: "I hope so too."

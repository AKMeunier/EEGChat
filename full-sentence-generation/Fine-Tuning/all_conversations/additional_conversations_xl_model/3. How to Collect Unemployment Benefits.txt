A: Hello. What are you doing here?
B: Hi! I lost my job, so here I am at the EDD.
A: That's rough. I lost my job three months ago.
B: I didn't know that. Maybe you can help me apply.
A: Sure, I can help. You just need some basic information about your job history.
B: I have that information for the company I last worked for.
A: They ask for information on all places you worked for the last 18 months.
B: I can get that. What else do they ask?
A: Name, residence, addresses, that kind of stuff, and most importantly, why you're not working.
B: You mean if I quit, or was fired.
A: Yes, and be truthful. They will call your former employers.
A: Thanks. That helps a lot.

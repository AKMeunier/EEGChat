A: I just came back from eating at the new steak place.
B: Oh, I've been wanting to go there. How was it?
A: Don't bother going.
B: Really? Why?
A: It was terrible. The food was cold, and the service sucked.
B: Oh, no. I was looking forward to trying it out.
A: Like I said, don't bother.
B: I mean, how bad was the food?
A: It was awful. They got my order wrong, and it was cold.
B: Well, maybe it was just an isolated incident.
A: I don't think so. I spoke to other diners, and they were disappointed, too.
B: I guess that means I have to find another place.

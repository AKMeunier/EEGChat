A: Top of the morning to you, Mr. Bus Driver.
B: Hi, good morning. Where are you off to today?
A: It's my first day of college.
B: Wow, you must be very excited.
A: You have no idea how much I am.
B: Do you know how to get there?
A: It's actually just a bus ride away.
B: Are you planning on taking the bus routinely?
A: Yes, I am. Why to spend money on gas when I could take the bus for less?
B: You know, as a student you're eligible to receive a discount.
A: No kidding. How much is the discount?
B: Are you paying for a month pass?
A: Yes, it cost fifty dollars.
B: Well, with a student discount it would cost twenty dollars less.
A: Thirty dollars for a month pass? That's quite a discount!
B: You should take advantage of it.

A: Here are the books I'm returning.
B: Looks like they're late. The late fee is $5.
A: Okay, I'm only one minute late.
B: One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter.
A: Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one month.
B: Look, the point is - they're late.
A: Screw you! I ain't payin $5.
B: I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again.
A: It's okay, because I don't even like this library.
B: This library doesn't like you either!
A: I am leaving! You are plain rude.
B: Leave! Nobody wants to see you.

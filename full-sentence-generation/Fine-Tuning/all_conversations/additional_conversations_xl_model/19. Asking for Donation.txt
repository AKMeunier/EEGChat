A: Would you like to donate money for Christopher?
B: Wait, what happened to Christopher?
A: He was hit by a car after school the other day.
B: What? That was terrible!
A: That day I was going to walk home with him, but I decided to go to the library.
B: I can't believe it. Is he okay?
A: He broke some bones, but other than that, he is okay.
B: Oh, great! So, why are you collecting money for him?
A: The hospital bills are sort of steep. His parents can't afford it.
B: Oh, wow! Well, here is my last $10. Please send my best to Chris.
A: Thank you. Every dollar counts.
B: Bless your heart for helping him out.

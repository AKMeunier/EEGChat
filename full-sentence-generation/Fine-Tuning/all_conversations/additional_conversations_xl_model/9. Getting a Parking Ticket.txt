A: Sir, is this your car?
B: Yes, are you giving me a ticket?
A: Unfortunately, yes, I am. Read the sign.
B: Which sign? I don't see a sign.
A: The sign above you, sir.
B: So, what? It says that we can't park on Mondays.
A: Yes, it does. Although, it also says that you can't park without a permit.
B: I didn't see that.
A: Well, I'm sorry, but I still have to give you the ticket.
B: Can't you just give me a warning?
A: I'm sorry, but I already started writing the ticket.
B: Fine. Give me the ticket. I'll fight it in court.

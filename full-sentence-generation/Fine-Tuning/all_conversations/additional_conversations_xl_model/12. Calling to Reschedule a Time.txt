A: Hello, may I please talk to a store manager?
B: Yes. What seems to be the problem?
A: I scheduled some furniture to be delivered today.
B: Would you like to change the delivery time?

B: That is not a problem, sir, I'll fix it.
A: Thank you. I was worried it had already been dispatched.
B: It's no problem at all.

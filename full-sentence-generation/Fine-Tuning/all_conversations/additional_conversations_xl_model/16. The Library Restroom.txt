A: Do you have a restroom?
B: Only for employees.
A: But I really need to go.
B: I can't let you go. There's a restroom in the market across from us though.
A: That restroom is really dirty. It smells like someone died in there.
B: Fine, I'll take you to our restroom.
A: Yay! Thank you so much.
B: We have to go secretly. If anyone sees you use the restroom, I'll be fired.
A: Don't worry. I will be small and quiet as a mouse.
B: Okay, good. The password is 595. Go quickly before anyone sees you.
A: Thank you for your kindness.
B: You owe me if we ever see each other again.

A: Excuse me, sir. How much for this lamp?
B: I'll sell it to you for $50.
A: Oh, no! That's way too expensive.
B: What price did you have in mind?
A: Maybe something closer to one fourth that much.

B: Make it $35 and you've got a deal.
A: Alright, that sounds good to me.
B: You sure drive a hard bargain!

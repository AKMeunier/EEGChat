A: Hello, this is my first time here. I could use some help.
B: Okay, I can help. What is it you want to do?
A: I need to use the database on your computer.
B: Well, I need something from you before I can allow you to do that.
A: What do you need from me?
B: I will need you to fill out this form, and show me identification.
A: Okay, I'll do that. I can then search your database?
B: Oh, no. You'll need to ask for permission.
A: Here's the form and my ID.
B: Wonderful. You can ask Mr. Lee for permission now.
A: That's super. Thanks.
B: You're welcome. Good luck.

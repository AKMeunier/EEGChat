A: It's time to start thinking about marketing our home.
B: Won't our realtor do that?
A: Yes, of course, but we can make some suggestions.
B: What suggestions?
A: I definitely want to have a "For Sale" sign on the lawn.
B: That's funny. Don't all houses for sale have that?
A: No, not really. A lot of homes are just listed on the Internet.
B: why do you want the sign then?
A: I still think it is an effective tool in selling a house.
B: Okay, you're the boss.
A: We'll also have a listing online, so we can reach more people.
B: Sounds good to me. We should do well then.

A: What's wrong? You look sad.
B: I was rejected from my dream school.
A: I'm sorry to hear that.

B: I don't know what to do anymore.
A: Look, that school didn't accept you, because you weren't the right fit.

A: Yeah! Just focus on the schools that do want you.
B: You're right! Yale made a mistake rejecting me.

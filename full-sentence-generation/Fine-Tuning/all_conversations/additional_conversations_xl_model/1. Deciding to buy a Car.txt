A: I have finally saved up enough to buy my first car.
B: That's great, dear. Do you have a car in mind?
A: I want a Honda Civic. I like to drive stick.
B: Have you been looking around?
A: Yes, I checked online. I have also been to some dealers.
B: You have to be careful when you go to dealers.
A: I know. They will try to take advantage of people.
B: Yes, you should take somebody that knows about cars.
A: Yeah, I'm going to take Joseph. He knows everything about cars.
B: Good idea. How much are you planning to spend?
A: I have $20,000.
B: Wow. Are you going to pay for the car? Or will you be making payments?
A: I was thinking about making payments. I don't want to get stuck without cash.

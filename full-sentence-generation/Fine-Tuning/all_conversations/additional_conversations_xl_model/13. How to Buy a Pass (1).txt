A: I have so many places to go today.
B: Are you planning on taking the bus?
A: Yes. I'm going to have to bring so much bus fare with me.

A: A pass? What's that?
B: It comes in the form of a card that allows you to pass on any bus.
A: And is it just for one day?
B: You can buy a bus pass for the day, week, month, and even a year.
A: I didn't know that. How do I buy one?
B: You can ask for one on the bus.
A: How much does the card cost?
B: The card itself is one dollar, but a pass for the day is five.
A: I only need to bring six dollars with me today?

A: Heard it's supposed to rain.
B: Where did you hear that from?
A: The news. The weatherman said there is a high probability of rain.
B: Since when have you started watching the news?
A: I've always watched the news. Well, at least to check out the weather.
B: What else did they say about the weekend?
A: I think they said it was going to rain throughout the weekend.
B: Throughout the weekend? Don't pull my chain.
A: I'm not. They said it, not me. I know you had plans.
B: Well, I don't believe it. Just like I don't believe you watch the news.
A: Okay, suit yourself. I'd take an umbrella though.
B: I won't. I'd rather get wet than listen to you.

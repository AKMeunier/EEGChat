A: I need a cab to the theater district.
B: We can get that for you right away.
A: Well, I don't need to be there for another hour.
B: Would you like to reserve a limo then?
A: That seems a bit much for me. Just a regular cab is fine.
B: We can't reserve a taxi that far in advance, sir.
A: So how do I get a cab in an hour then?
B: If you go right outside our lobby when you are ready, a staff member will hail one for you.
A: Do I have to tip the guy who gets the cab for me?
B: Tips aren't mandatory, but they are appreciated.
A: Maybe I'll just hail the cab myself then.
B: That's also an option.

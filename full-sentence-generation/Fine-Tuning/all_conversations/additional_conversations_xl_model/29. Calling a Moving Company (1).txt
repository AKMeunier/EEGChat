A: Hey, were you able to find a new home to move into?
B: Yes, I did. Now I just have to move my things over to the new place.
A: That's great! I'm glad you found a new place.
B: Me too. Have you ever used a moving company before?
A: Yes, I have. And the company is not bad.
B: I'm planning on moving soon. I have never called a moving company before.
A: Oh, I see. You have to call them as soon as possible.
B: Really? Why is that?
A: Moving companies tend to get booked really fast, especially during the summer.
B: That makes sense. I guess I should call a moving company right now.
A: Good luck. I hope the move transitions smoothly.
B: Thanks you for your advice. See you later!

A: I would like to reserve The Hunger Games. 
B: Everyone wants to reserve that book these days.
A: It's really popular, because the movie just came out.
B: You have to pay $1 to reserve the book.
A: What?! That's ridiculous.
B: Like you said, it's popular.
A: I have to think about it then.
B: I personally think $1 is nothing. It's cheaper than buying the book.
A: How much is the book?
B: On the back, it says it's $15. It depends on the bookstore you go to though.
A: Fine, I'll give you a $1.
B: You won't regret it! The book is really good.

A: Hello. I am number G85.
B: How may I help you today?
A: I would like to apply for my driving permit.
B: Are you 16 years old? That's the minimum age.
A: Yes, I am. Here is my ID.
B: Thank you. May I see your form?
A: Oh, of course. Would I be able to take the written today?
B: If you have the $30, then yes, you can take it.

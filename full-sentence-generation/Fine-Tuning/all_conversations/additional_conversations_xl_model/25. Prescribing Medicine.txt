A: I saw a commercial about a heart medication.
B: You don't have any heart problems.
A: I know, but the ad suggested I ask my doctor if that medication was right for me.
B: As your doctor, I can tell you that you don't need any heart medication.
A: Okay, what about this medication that has the commercial with the couple in the bathtub?
B: What about it?
A: Can you prescribe that to me?
B: The only thing I am prescribing you is an antibiotic for your strep throat.
A: What do I do with this piece of paper?
B: Take it to the pharmacy, and the pharmacist will give you the antibiotic.
A: What if it doesn't work?
B: Come back to see me again.

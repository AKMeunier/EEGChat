A: There are some amenities missing from my hotel room.
B: I'm so sorry to hear that. What is your room number and what's missing?
A: I'm in room 143; there is no hairdryer.
B: I can send one up to you right away.
A: Great! So that I can use that hairdryer, can you also send up shampoo and conditioner?
B: There should have been a basket in the bathroom with all that.
A: Well, there isn't.
B: Anything else I can send up to your room?
A: Yes, I need an iron and an ironing board.
B: Those aren't in your closet?
A: Maybe they are invisible. I don't see them.
B: I do apologize. I'll bring them personally.

A: Do you ever take public transportation to get around?
B: Before I frequently did. Not so much anymore. Why do you ask?
A: I wanted some information about the public transportation that is available in the city.
B: I could provide you with some. What would you like to know?
A: What kind of public transportation is there?
B: There is a local shuttle bus that could take you almost anywhere in the city.
A: It does not take you outside the city?
B: Unfortunately it does not. But it's cheaper than other public buses that do.
A: I see. And where is the nearest stop from here?
B: It's really close. Just a block away towards that direction.
A: That way? I see. Thank you.
B: You can't miss it, and you're welcome.

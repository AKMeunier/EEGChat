A: I checked the whole car, and it has some problems.
B: What kind of problems does it have?
A: The brakes need to be replaced, as well as the power steering.
B: Is that all? That seems like an easy fix.
A: That's not all. The alternator seems to be malfunctioning.
B: How much would it cost me to fix it all?
A: It'll cost around $300 to $400.
B: That's not too bad. Is there anything else?
A: From what I can tell, no. I would recommend buying it.
B: Let me call the seller, and I will let you know if you can start.
A: Great. I can start right away, if he gives you the thumbs up.
B: He said that it's fine. I will be back for the car when you're done.

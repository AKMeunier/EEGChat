A: Hey! Are you busy?
B: Not at the moment. What's going on?
A: I wanted to run something by you. It's an idea for work.
B: Okay, shoot.
A: Well, I'm thinking of asking my boss to change the work schedule.
B: Why? What's your idea?
A: It's to change from five, eight-hour days, to four, ten-hour days.
B: Wow. That's a big change. I don't think he'll go for it.
A: It's still 40 hours per week, and everyone will get an extra day off.
B: I don't think it will work. It's not a good idea.
A: Why is it not a good idea?
B: Companies should be open five days a week. Sorry, I don't like it.

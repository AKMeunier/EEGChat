A: I have an early meeting, so can I get a wake-up call?
B: Sure! What time should we call you?
A: Can you call my room at six in the morning?
B: Just tell me your room number.
A: I'm staying in room 302.
B: Okay, Mr. Roberts. We'll call you at 6 a.m.
A: What happens if I don't answer?
B: Then you'll probably miss your meeting.
A: Can I request a second wake-up call?
B: What time should we schedule the second wake-up call?
A: Call me again at 6:15 a.m. if I don't answer at six.

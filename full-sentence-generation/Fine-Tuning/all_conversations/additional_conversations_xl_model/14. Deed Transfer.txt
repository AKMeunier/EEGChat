A: My dad told me he was going to put his second house in my name.
B: The one on Bronson Street?
A: Yes, that's the one.
B: Wow, that's a nice house.
A: Yes, it is. He wants me to start taking on more responsibilities.
B: Well, that will do it. It's not easy managing a home.
A: I guess not, but I won't be living in it now.
B: So what's he doing?
A: He's just doing a Quit Claim deed.
B: What's that?
A: It's just a deed transfer changing ownership of the home.
B: It's not a sale?
A: No. It's usually done between family members.

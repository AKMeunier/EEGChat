A: Good morning, Alice. Today's the big day!
B: Yes, it is. Are we ready for this?
A: I think so. You know I've been working on the house.
B: I know, Richard. I guess I'm just nervous.
A: I wouldn't worry, babe. We've worked very hard on this.
B: Yes. I know, but still ...
A: We cleaned the house, spruced up the yard, and painted the interior.
B: I know, Richard. I'm worried about the things we didn't do.
A: I think we'll be okay. If something comes up, we'll deal with it then.
B: You think of everything.
A: No. I don't, Alice. We think of everything.
B: You're right. We'll be ready.

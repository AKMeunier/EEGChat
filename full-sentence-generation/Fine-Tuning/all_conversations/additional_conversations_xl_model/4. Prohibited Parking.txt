B: Yes, is there a problem?
A: I'm sorry to be the one to tell you, but you can't park here.

A: Yes, unfortunately you cannot.
B: Oh, I was not aware that you couldn't park here.

B: That's so considerate of you. Thank you.
A: You're welcome. Just keep it in mind for the next time.
B: Don't worry. I won't forget.

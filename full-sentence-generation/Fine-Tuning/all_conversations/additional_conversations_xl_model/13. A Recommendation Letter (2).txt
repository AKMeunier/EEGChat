A: My professor wrote a really bad recommendation letter for me.
B: You read his recommendation letter?
A: Yeah. I couldn't resist.
B: This is why you shouldn't read it. You might not like what you see.
A: He wrote such boring things about me. 
B: What did he write?
A: Just that I'm a diligent student who does well.
B: At least it was nothing bad. You can always ask another professor.
A: I know, but I don't have time.
B: When do you need another recommendation letter by?
A: I need one by this Friday.
B: Oh, wow! Maybe you should just send the one you have now.

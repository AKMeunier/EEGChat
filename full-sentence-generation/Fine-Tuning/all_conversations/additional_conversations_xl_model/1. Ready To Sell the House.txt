A: Now that we found our new home, it's time to sell our old one.
B: I know. It makes me sad.
A: Why is that, Dorothy?
B: I don't know. I guess it's because we've lived here so long.
A: I know, baby. But it's time to move on.
B: Yes, I know. The kids are all grown up now.
A: I'll contact our realtor tomorrow.
B: Are you going to use the same one?
A: No, I don't think so. I think I'll try someone new.
B: Why is that?
A: No reason, really. I just want to check around. We're in no hurry.
B: That's true. I'm good with that.

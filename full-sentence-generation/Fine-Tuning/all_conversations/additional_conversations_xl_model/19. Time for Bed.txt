A: Hello, is this the Smith residence?
A: Children, it's time to go to bed!
B: But we're not sleepy yet!
A: If you get into bed right now, I'll read you a fairytale.
B: One with a princess and a prince?
A: Of course, and a magical dragon, too.
B: Why do we hear fairytales before bed?
A: So that the magic from stories can grow while you're sleeping.
B: What does it grow into?
A: Why, magical dreams, of course!
B: Please read us two tonight!
A: Alright, but only if you sleep as soon as I'm done!
B: We will. It's a promise!

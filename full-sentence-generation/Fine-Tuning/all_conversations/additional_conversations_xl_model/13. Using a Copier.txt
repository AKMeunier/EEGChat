A: How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?
B: It depends. Do you want your copy in color or black and white?
A: I want it in color.
B: Then it will be 20 cents per page.
A: That's kind of expensive.
B: Yeah, but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own.
A: I have one, but it's broken.
B: That sucks. Well, if money's an issue, you can copy your stuff in black and white.
A: No, it has to be color.
B: Do you really not have 20 cents?
A: I do, but I'm really cheap.
B: Well, you don't really have a choice at this point.

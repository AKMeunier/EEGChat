A: Dude, I forgot to tell you Â– I'm going out with Sarah.
B: Which one is Sarah? You date so many girls that I get confused.
A: First off, I don't date that many girls, and secondly you're always confused.
B: True. So, which one is she? Is she in your class?
A: Nope. She's the girl from the restaurant we go to in downtown.
B: From Green Bamboo? Which girl?
A: The cute one. You know the one with the tattoo up her thigh?
B: I think I would have noticed that.
A: She's the only one with blonde hair.
B: Well, why didn't you just say that? That's Sarah?
A: Well, I know you check her out. I assumed you saw the tattoo.
B: I'm not that big of a pervert.

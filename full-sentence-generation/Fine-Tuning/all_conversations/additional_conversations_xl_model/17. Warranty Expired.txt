B: What do you mean use the warranty?
A: The warranty promises a new phone if this one breaks.
B: Did something happen to it?
A: I dropped it and the screen cracked very badly.
B: It says here that your warranty has expired.
A: What! That can't be true!

B: Well, if you trade it in, you'll get a discount.
A: Well, I suppose it won't hurt.
B: I suggest you buy a longer warranty on this one, sir.

A: Hello, I wanted to ask you about car insurance prices.
B: Sure thing. Please, have a seat.
A: Thank you. I just bought my first car.
B: Great, congratulations! What kind of car is it?
A: It's a 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.
B: Oh, so it's an older make.
A: Yes, but it's in good condition. So, how much would the payments be?
B: Depends. Have you been in any accidents?
A: No, I have not.
B: Have you gotten any driving tickets?
A: Nope. That can affect the insurance rate?
B: At times. Well, everything seems in order. You would have to pay $75 monthly.
A: That sounds great.

A: Hey Professor Lopez, I need a favor.
B: What kind of favor?
A: Can you write a recommendation letter for me?
B: I'm sorry, but I can't.
A: Why not? I was a good student.
B: Yes, you were. The thing is, I don't know you that well.
A: I'll just give you my resume, and you can write about how great I am!
B: I can't. I don't think I can write you a good letter.
A: But I don't know who else to ask.
B: Ask someone who knows you as more than just a student.
A: I honestly never had a professor I felt close to.
B: Then, you can only hope a professor writes a letter for you regardless of that fact.

A: I have never bought a bus pass before. Do you know how?
B: Yes I do. You can buy it from the bus driver.
A: What kinds of bus passes do they have?
B: They have day passes, week passes, and month passes.
A: How much is the monthly pass?
B: It's 64 dollars, but if you're a student, you can get it for 35 dollars.
A: Yes. I'm a student. I think I'll get the monthly pass.
B: Since you'll be getting the student discount, you need to show your student I.D.

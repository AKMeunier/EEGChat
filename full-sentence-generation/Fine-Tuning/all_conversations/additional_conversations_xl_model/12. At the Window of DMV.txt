A: Hello, I'm here to renew my registration.
B: Okay, may I please have your renewal notice?
A: Yes, here it is. Do you need my driver's license?
B: No, this is fine. It seems you missed your deadline.
A: Yes, I completely forgot.
B: Well, it's going to cost you a bit more to renew it.
A: How much more will it cost?
B: It was going to be $88, now it's going to be $120.
A: Well, I guess I'm going to have to be more careful.
B: It would be a good idea. Have you done the smog check?
A: No, is that required?
B: It is this year. You'll have to do it again two years from now.
A: Can I come back tomorrow?
B: Yes. Don't wait in line. Come directly to me.

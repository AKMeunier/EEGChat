A: I finally found an apartment to move in.
B: That's great to hear. Kudos to you.
A: Thanks, it wasn't easy finding one.
B: Are you moving in soon?
A: Yes I am. This weekend, in fact.
B: Have you hired any movers?
A: No, I have not.
B: Why not? Don't you know of any in the area?
A: That's not the problem. I don't think I have enough to afford movers.
B: That's too bad. Is there anything I could do to help?
A: Actually, I was going to ask for your help.
B: You're going to need at least one more other person to help you move.
A: You're right about that. So can I count on you to help me?
B: You bet. I would be happy to help you move.

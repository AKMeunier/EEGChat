A: Mr. Smith, we received a counteroffer on your house.
B: For which property?
A: It's for the lot on 6th Avenue.
B: Okay, I've been waiting for this.
A: Yes, and I think it is a very good offer.
B: Okay, lay it on me.
A: The buyer upped his offer to $375,000.
B: Are you kidding me? That's still $7,500 below list.
A: I know, Mr. Smith, but the market is weak right now.
B: I don't care. I'm not losing money on this.
A: You won't be losing money, sir.
B: I don't care. I'm not selling at that price.

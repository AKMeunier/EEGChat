A: I must admit, Ms. Price, I'm concerned about security.
B: Don't worry, Mr. King. We will provide the security on your home.
A: What kinds of things do you do?
B: We make it look like someone is living in your home while it's listed.
A: How do you do that?
B: We do several things. We stop deliveries, mow the lawn, and set timers.
A: Is that all you do?
B: No, we have our agents drop by from time to time.
A: Oh, that's good.
B: Yes, we take home security seriously.
A: Thanks, Ms. Price. I feel much better now.
B: You are very welcome. Thank you.

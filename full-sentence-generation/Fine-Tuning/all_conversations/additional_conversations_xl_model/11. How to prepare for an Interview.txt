A: I was hoping you could help me.
B: I'll try. What help do you need?
A: I'm having an interview tomorrow morning. I'm very nervous.
B: That's great! Why are you nervous though?
A: I don't do well in interviews.
B: They can be frightening, but you can do it.
A: I'm afraid they'll ask me something I won't know.
B: You should prepare yourself. Go online, and look at their website.
A: Now why didn't I think of that?
B: It's a good idea to know everything you can about them first.
A: That's an excellent idea! Thanks.
B: You're welcome. If you need more help, give me a call.

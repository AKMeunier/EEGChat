A: I hate my roommate.
B: I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong with her?
A: A lot of things. First of all, she snores so loudly!
B: That's not really her fault. What else?
A: She never takes a shower.
B: That's disgusting! You should tell her to take a shower.
A: I did! She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.
B: Ouch! Did you try to get a new roommate?
A: I tried, but I could not. No one was willing to switch.
B: I guess you can get a new room by yourself.
A: I can't afford it. Ugh, I hate her so much.
B: It's okay. The year will be over before you know it.

A: I hate Professor Hernandez!
B: Me too! He keeps calling me stupid!
A: You think that's bad? He gave me an F, because I double spaced my essay!
B: But every professor wants essays double spaced. He's crazy!
A: Professor Hernandez is weird. He wants essays triple spaced.
B: That's just a waste of paper. Why does he like triple spacing?
A: He says it's because he has to make a lot of corrections, because we're stupid.
B: We should start a petition, and get him fired!
A: We should, but he can find out.
B: I know. If he found out, he would ruin everyone's life.
A: He is so evil.
B: That's why this petition has to work!

ALICE: "You take such good care of your plants, Joan."
JOAN: "I try my best. I love plants."
ALICE: "I have killed every plant I have ever owned."
JOAN: "How, Alice?"
ALICE: "I don't know. I water them and make sure they get enough sun, but they still die."
JOAN: "That's strange."
ALICE: "I know. I don't buy plants anymore."
JOAN: "That's sad. Plants are beautiful and they provide oxygen too."
ALICE: "Can you teach me how to care for plants?"
JOAN: "Sure. I'm going on vacation tomorrow. I'll be gone for a couple of weeks. We can start after I get back."
ALICE: "Ok! Can we shop for the plants together?"
JOAN: "Yes. Let's get a couple of plants that require low maintenance."
ALICE: "What do you mean by low maintenance?"
JOAN: "Plants that don't need much attention."
ALICE: "That will be perfect for me."
JOAN: "I'll make a list of good plants to start with."
ALICE: "What are you going to do about all of your plants while you're on vacation?"
JOAN: "Well, I was going to ask you to water them for me, but I think I'll ask my sister instead."
ALICE: "Yeah, that's a good idea."

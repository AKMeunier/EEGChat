Jim:  Are you excited about your promotion?
Dwight:  Yeah, but I'm also a little nervous.  
Jim:  Why?  You'll do a great job at your new department.
Dwight:  I hope my new boss is nice.
Jim:  I heard she is nice but also serious about getting the job done.
Dwight:  I always get my job done.
Jim:  Then you shouldn't have any problems.
Dwight:  Do you have any advice for me?
Jim:  Be a team player.  Get along with your new co-workers.
Dwight:  I will!  That's really important to me.

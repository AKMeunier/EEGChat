BARBARA: "Hi Alice. How did you like the hotel?"
ALICE: "It was lovely, Barbara. The rooms were spacious and clean."
BARBARA: "Did you get a good deal on it?"
ALICE: "Yeah. They had an online special. If you reserved a room three weeks early, you got 20% off the regular room rate."
BARBARA: "That's a good deal."
ALICE: "The swimming pool and spa were really nice too. The swimming pool was warm. There was also a sauna."
BARBARA: "Oh, that's very nice. Joe loves saunas. I need to tell him about this place."
ALICE: "The parking is free and so is the Wi-Fi."
BARBARA: "That's good to know."
ALICE: "There's a shuttle bus that takes you to the downtown area where all of the shops and restaurants are. It was very convenient."
BARBARA: "Anything else?"
ALICE: "The concierge was very helpful and the front desk clerks were very nice."
BARBARA: "Sounds like it was a wonderful place to stay."
ALICE: "It was. I would recommend this place to everyone."
BARBARA: "Is there a restaurant in the hotel?"
ALICE: "Yes. They have great food. It's a little expensive, but very delicious. They have a fantastic breakfast buffet every morning too."
BARBARA: "Wow! I'm definitely going to make a reservation here."
ALICE: "I can't wait to go back."

Mike:  I don't know what to get Ann for our anniversary.
James:  What about jewelry?
Mike:  She doesn't like my taste in jewelry.
James:  How about clothes?
Mike:  She doesn't like my taste in clothes.
James:  Have you asked her what she wants?
Mike:  No.  I want it to be a surprise.
James:  How can you surprise her if she doesn't like your taste in anything?
Mike:  That's why I need your help.
James:  I can't help you.  Sheila doesn't like my taste either.

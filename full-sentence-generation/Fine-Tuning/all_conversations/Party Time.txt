Reggie:  We're going to a party tonight.  Do you want to join us?
Ophelia:  No, I can't.  I have to finish my homework.
Reggie:  Do you have a lot of homework?
Ophelia:  Yes.  I have a math test tomorrow too.
Reggie:  That's too bad.  It's supposed to be a big party.
Ophelia:  I wish I could go, but I'm so behind in my classes.
Reggie:  Why are you so behind?
Ophelia:  I was sick for a few days and missed several classes.
Reggie:  Do you need help studying?
Ophelia:  No.  I just need to focus on my school work.

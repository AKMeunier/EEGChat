Rick:  Hey Steve, do you want to join us for lunch?
Steve:  No.  I have to work.
Rick:  What about drinks after work?
Steve:  No.  I'm staying late tonight.
Rick:  Don't you stay late every night?
Steve:  Yeah.  I need to get some things done.
Rick:  You work too much.
Steve:  That's what my wife says.
Rick:  Don't you think that's a problem?
Steve:  Yeah.  Tonight's our wedding anniversary too.
Rick:  You'd better go home!

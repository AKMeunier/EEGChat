B: Hi there!
A: I'm so glad you could squeeze me into your schedule today, doctor.
B: Sure, what seems to be the problem?
A: I was in a small car accident last month, but only recently noticed some neck pain.
B: Is there any bruising?
A: Not that I can see.
B: Show me where the pain is.
A: The pain feels like a sharp stabbing followed by a dull throbbing.
B: I don't see bruising, but there could be nerve damage.
A: So what do I do next?
B: I'm going to refer you to a nerve specialist.
A: Do you think I can sue?
B: Is that what this is all about?

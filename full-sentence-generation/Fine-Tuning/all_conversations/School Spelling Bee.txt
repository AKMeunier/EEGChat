CAROL: "Hi Sue. Did you hear about the spelling bee at school?"
SUE: "Hi Carol. Yes. Actually, my daughter, Sylvia, is in the competition."
CAROL: "How exciting! I wish I could go watch it."
SUE: "You should. It's a lot of fun, but also very stressful."
CAROL: "I know. I won the school spelling bee when I was in high school."
SUE: "You did? I didn't know that."
CAROL: "I was undefeated until I graduated from high school."
SUE: "Wow! That's amazing. Is that why you became an English teacher?"
CAROL: "Well, that's part of the reason. I like words. I like reading and writing."
SUE: "You should come with us tonight."
CAROL: "I would love to. What time does it start?"
SUE: "7 pm. But we will have to leave around 6:30. Sylvia needs to be there early."
CAROL: "Ok. I'll be ready at 6:30. I'm so excited. I hope Sylvia wins."
SUE: "We do too. Do you have any advice for her?"
CAROL: "Just stay focused and concentrate on each word."

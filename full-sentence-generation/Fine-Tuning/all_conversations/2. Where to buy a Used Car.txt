A: Hey, Mark. Do you know where I can look for used cars?
B: You could always check online. My friend bought a car from Craigslist.
A: Yeah, I was thinking about that. Do you know any other way?
B: There is a dealership that sells used cars on Atlantic Boulevard.
A: Where is it? I have never seen one.
B: It's on the corner of 7th and Atlantic.
A: Oh, by the Burger King?
B: Yeah. They have a pretty good selection. You should check it out.
A: I'm down. Can you go with me?
B: Sure, I am free tomorrow and Thursday. Shoot me a text.
A: Will do, man. Thanks.
B: Sure thing, bro. You owe me, though.

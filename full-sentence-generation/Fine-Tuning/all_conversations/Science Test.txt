JOE: "Hey Craig, how did you do on the Science test?"
CRAIG: "Oh, hi Joe. I did really badly on it. I failed it."
JOE: "How did you fail it?"
CRAIG: "I didn't study for it. I was too busy playing video games."
JOE: "That's too bad."
CRAIG: "I don't know if I can pass the class now."
JOE: "What are you going to do?"
CRAIG: "I'm afraid to tell my parents. They will be very disappointed."
JOE: "Maybe the teacher will let you take the test again."
CRAIG: "That would be wonderful."
JOE: "I did poorly on my English test last week and my teacher let me take it again."
CRAIG: "Wow! That's good to hear. Maybe our science teacher will let me take it again."
JOE: "You better study next time."
CRAIG: "I know! No more video games for me."
JOE: "What are you going to do now?"
CRAIG: "I'm going to our science teacher's office and talk to him about my test. Then I'm going to go to the library and study for my math test."
JOE: "That's a good idea! I'll meet you at the library later. Good luck with our science teacher."
CRAIG: "Thanks! I'll need it!"

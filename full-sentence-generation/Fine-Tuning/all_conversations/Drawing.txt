HELEN: "Do you know how to draw?"
SUE: "Yes. Drawing is one of my hobbies."
HELEN: "Really? I didn't know that."
SUE: "I doodle when I'm bored."
HELEN: "Can you help my son with his school project?"
SUE: "Sure. What does he need to do?"
HELEN: "He needs to draw a picture of a big castle."
SUE: "That's not hard at all. When is it due?"
HELEN: "Tomorrow."
SUE: "Oh, that soon?"
HELEN: "Yeah. He didn't tell me until today."
SUE: "Ok, I can come by after dinner."
HELEN: "Why don't you come for dinner?"
SUE: "That would be lovely. Thank you."
HELEN: "Thank you! I cannot draw at all and I was so worried about this assignment."
SUE: "Don't worry. He will have an awesome castle."

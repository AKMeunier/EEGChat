SARAH: "Hey Ted, why do you look so nervous?"
TED: "I'm going to ask the boss for a raise."
SARAH: "You should. You deserve a raise. You work very hard."
TED: "I do work hard. I'm here early every day and I leave late every night."
SARAH: "Yeah, you do. You also help other people when they need help. You've helped me many times."
TED: "Also, I've been here for 10 years. My last raise was three years ago."
SARAH: "Three years? Then I think it's definitely time for a raise."
TED: "Do you think she will say yes?"
SARAH: "I think she will. She is nice. She listens well and she is also very fair."
TED: "I wrote a short report about why I deserve a raise."
SARAH: "Only you would do that. You are so detail-oriented."
TED: "I like to be prepared about everything."
SARAH: "That's another reason why you should get a raise."
TED: "Ok. I'm ready to talk to her?"
SARAH: "You can't talk to her today."
TED: "Why not?"
SARAH: "She's on a business trip."

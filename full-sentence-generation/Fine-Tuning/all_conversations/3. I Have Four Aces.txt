A: I'm a good card player.
B: Why is that?
A: Because I watch the other players.
B: What do you mean?
A: People will tell you if they have a good hand.
B: How do they do that?
A: For example, a friend of mine licks his lips.
B: When he licks his lips, you know he has a good hand?
A: I know he has a good hand, so I don't bet.
B: He never wins your money?
A: Nope, and it drives him crazy.
B: He knows you can't read his mind. Maybe he thinks you're cheating.

LINDA: "Hey Ashley, what are you going to do this Winter Break?"
ASHLEY: "I'm going skiing with some friends. What about you, Linda?"
LINDA: "I'm going to visit my parents for a few days."
ASHLEY: "That's nice. Do they live near?"
LINDA: "No. They live in New York."
ASHLEY: "Does it snow a lot during the winter there?"
LINDA: "Yeah. It's beautiful. I take a lot of pictures since we don't get much snow here."
ASHLEY: "Is that where your hometown is?"
LINDA: "Yeah. I miss seeing snow."
ASHLEY: "You should go skiing with us one day. There's a lot of snow in the mountains during the winter."
LINDA: "That's an idea. But I don't know how to ski?"
ASHLEY: "You don't know how to ski, but you love snow?"
LINDA: "Yeah, we didn't do much skiing growing up."
ASHLEY: "I'll teach you then. Skiing is fun!"
LINDA: "That's ok. I'd rather just drink hot chocolate and snuggle in warm blankets by the fireplace."
ASHLEY: "Winter is the best time for that, too!"

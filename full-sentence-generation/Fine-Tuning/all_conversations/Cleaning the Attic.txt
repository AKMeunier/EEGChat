GARY: "Hey Ted. Do you have any boxes you're not using?"
TED: "I think so. I have to check my garage."
GARY: "Great. Thanks."
TED: "Are you moving?"
GARY: "No. I need to clean out my attic today. It's getting full up there."
TED: "That's a big chore."
GARY: "I know. I don't even remember what's in there anymore."
TED: "Well, if you don't know what's in there, you probably don't need it."
GARY: "That's what my wife said."
TED: "I had to clean out my attic last month and my wife said the same thing to me."
GARY: "They must be talking to each other."
TED: "What are you going to do with all the stuff?"
GARY: "I think I'm going to have a garage sale next weekend. What did you do with all of your stuff?"
TED: "I threw half of it away and donated the other half."
GARY: "That's a good idea. Maybe I'll donate the things I don't need."
TED: "What about the garage sale?"
GARY: "That's just going to be another chore to do. I'd rather go golfing."
TED: "Good thinking!"

LINDA: "Hello?"
SHARON: "Hi Linda. This is Sharon. Do you have time for lunch today?"
LINDA: "No, I have to go to the mall. I have to get a birthday present for Phil."
SHARON: "What are you going to get him?"
LINDA: "I don't know. He seems to have everything."
SHARON: "Does he have a hobby?"
LINDA: "Yeah. He loves golf, but he has everything he needs for golf."
SHARON: "What about clothes or shoes?"
LINDA: "He has plenty of clothes and shoes."
SHARON: "Jewelry?"
LINDA: "He doesn't wear jewelry."
SHARON: "Wow! I don't know what else to suggest."
LINDA: "That's what I mean. He has everything!"
SHARON: "What are you going to do?"
LINDA: "I don't know. I'm just going to go to the mall and hope I find something. Would you like to come with me?"
SHARON: "Sure. We can grab lunch at the mall."
LINDA: "That's a good idea. We'll need a break from searching for his gift."
SHARON: "When is Phil's birthday?"
LINDA: "Tomorrow."
SHARON: "Tomorrow? We better leave now."

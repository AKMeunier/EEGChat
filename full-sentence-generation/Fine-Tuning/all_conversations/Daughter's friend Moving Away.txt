MOM: "Sally, what's wrong? Why do you look so sad?"
SALLY: "Mom, Candace is moving away."
MOM: "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Why is she moving?"
SALLY: "Her dad got a job in another state."
MOM: "Where is she moving?"
SALLY: "To California. That's across the country."
MOM: "There are many ways you can still keep in touch. You can e-mail, text, and call each other on the phone."
SALLY: "But it won't be the same as seeing each other every day. She is my best friend. I'm going to miss her."
MOM: "I know you will. When are they moving?"
SALLY: "At the end of June when the school year ends. In two months."
MOM: "Would you like to invite her over this weekend? You can have a sleepover."
SALLY: "Yes, please. That would be great. We're going to try to hang out as much as possible before she moves."
MOM: "That sounds like a good plan."
SALLY: "Can we visit her in California?"
MOM: "It's pretty far from us. We don't know anyone there."
SALLY: "Yes, we do. Candace and her family."

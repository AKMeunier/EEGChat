A: How long have we've been waiting for this bus?
B: Almost one hour. I think it's late.
A: It is late! What is taking this bus driver so long to get here?
B: Probably traffic. You know how traffic could be on the weekends.
A: That is not a good excuse. Bus drivers should know how to maneuver past traffic.
B: That's easy for you to say.
A: I just want the bus to arrive already. I want to go home.
B: It's bound to arrive any minute now.
A: I hope you're right. My patience has all extinguished.
B: Wait. I think I see it coming in the distance!
A: Thank goodness! I couldn't possibly wait another minute.
B: False alarm. It was just a truck. Sorry about that.

Ethan:  Have you seen the latest smartwatch?
Dan:  Yes.  It's really cool.
Ethan:  Do you have one?
Dan:  No.  I'm thinking about getting one soon.
Ethan:  How much are they?
Dan:  They are pretty expensive.  
Ethan:  I wish I could get one.
Dan:  Why?  You never answer your calls or texts.
Ethan:  If it's on my wrist, then maybe I will use it.
Dan:  You're just going to waste your money.

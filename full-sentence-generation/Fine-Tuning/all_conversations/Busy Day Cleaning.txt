KAREN: "Hi Sally. How are you today?"
SALLY: "Hi Karen. I have so many things to do today."
KAREN: "What do you have to do?"
SALLY: "I have to do several loads of laundry, vacuum the whole house, and clean the kitchen."
KAREN: "Wow! That's a lot of stuff to do. Why don't you do some of that tomorrow?"
SALLY: "My mother-in-law is coming tonight."
KAREN: "I completely understand."
SALLY: "She likes a very neat and tidy house."
KAREN: "I know what you mean. My mom is very clean and organized too."
SALLY: "I should've started a few days ago, but I was so busy at work."
KAREN: "Why doesn't your husband help you?"
SALLY: "He did help me. He mowed the lawn, cleaned all of the bathrooms, and set up the guest room yesterday."
KAREN: "Wow! He did a lot too."
SALLY: "I also have to go grocery shopping."
KAREN: "What a busy day! Do you need any help?"
SALLY: "No, that's ok."
KAREN: "I'm not busy today. I can help you."
SALLY: "Really? Could you go grocery shopping for me? I already made my shopping list."
KAREN: "Of course! You can pay me back when I drop off the groceries."
SALLY: "Thank you so much! I really appreciate it."
KAREN: "That's what friends and neighbors are for."

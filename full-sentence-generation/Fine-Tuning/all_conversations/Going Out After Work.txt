Ron:  Sure.  What time?
Harry:  We're leaving at 5 PM.
Ron:  Ok.  I need to call my wife and tell her I will be home late.
Harry:  I should do that too.
Ron:  Are you celebrating something?
Harry:  Yes!  We finally finished a big project.
Ron:  That's great news!  
Harry:  Let me know if you can join us later.

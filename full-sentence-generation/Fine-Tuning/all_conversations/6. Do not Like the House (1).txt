A: I think this house will fill all you needs, Mr. Jones.
B: Well, I don't particularly like the neighborhood.
A: I understand your concern, Mr. Jones, but let's take a look inside.
B: Okay, but I'm really concerned about the neighborhood.
A: That's okay, Mr. Jones. We're not married to this home.
B: I guess we can look inside since we're here.
A: Great! Let's go inside. It's a beautiful home.
B: I don't like it already. The porch is too small. I have a big family.
A: All right, Mr. Jones. This may not be the right house for you.
B: That's what I've been trying to tell you.
A: That's okay. I've got more homes to show you.
B: That's good to hear.

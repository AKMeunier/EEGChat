JOAN: "Hey Cathy. Why do you look so down?"
CATHY: "Oh, hi Joan. I just got my report card."
JOAN: "Is it that bad?"
CATHY: "I was hoping to get a good grade in Science class, but I didn't."
JOAN: "That's a hard class."
CATHY: "I know. I did well in all of my other classes, but that one."
JOAN: "You should think about the good grades you received. Don't worry about one class."
CATHY: "I know. But I want to be a scientist. So, this is discouraging to me."
JOAN: "Just study harder next time. You can do it."
CATHY: "Thanks for your encouragement. How did you do?"
JOAN: "I did well. I was most worried about math."
CATHY: "How did you do in your math class?"
JOAN: "Better than I expected. But not a perfect grade."
CATHY: "How about science?"
JOAN: "Oh, I did ok."
CATHY: "What does ok mean?"
JOAN: "I did really well."
CATHY: "I'm happy for you. But I'm sad for myself again."

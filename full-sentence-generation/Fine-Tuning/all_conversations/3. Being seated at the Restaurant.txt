A: Welcome to the Silver Wok. How can I help you?
B: Hello, I was hoping you have a table.
A: We should be okay. How many guests?
B: It's a birthday dinner. We have 12 guests.
A: Oh, let me check if I have room for you.^ Your name, please.
B: I'm Mr. Johnson. I would appreciate it.
A: Okay, Mr. Johnson. I will have a table soon.
B: Oh, that's wonderful.
A: It's near the back. Is that okay?
B: Yes, I suppose it is. I was hoping for window seating though.
A: I can accommodate you, but it will take a little more time, sir.
B: That's okay. We'll wait.

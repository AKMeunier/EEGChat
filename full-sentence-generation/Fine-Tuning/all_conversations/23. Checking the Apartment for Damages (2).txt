A: Would it be okay if I checked the apartment for any damages?
B: That's fine with me. Step inside.

B: Feel free to take your time.
A: Right away I noticed some cracks on the kitchen tile.
B: Where? Can you show me?
A: Yes. It's right at the corner, next to the sink.
B: I see it. I'll have that repaired right away.
A: Thank you. That would be great.
B: Take a carful look around the apartment, and tell me of anything else that needs tending to.
A: Here's something else. These doors are kind of loose.
B: It's the screws on them. I'll have the screws replaced as soon as possible.

Paula:  What is Jessica doing?
Jon:  She's organizing her office.
Paula:  Again?  She is always organizing her office.
Jon:  Everything has to be in the right place.
Paula:  I know.  One time she got mad at me because I accidentally moved her plant.
Jon:  That's funny.
Paula:  That's not funny.  She got very mad at me.
Jon:  Then don't move her things.
Paula:  I will never touch anything in her office again.
Jon:  She's just a neat freak.

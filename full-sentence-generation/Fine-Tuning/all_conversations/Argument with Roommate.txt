BETTY: "Hey Nancy, why do you look so worried?"
NANCY: "Oh, hi Betty. Christine and I had a big argument and she has decided to move out."
BETTY: "What did you argue about?"
NANCY: "I told her that she needs to help clean up around the apartment."
BETTY: "What happened after you told her that?"
NANCY: "She got upset and said she is moving out. But it's the truth. She never helps around house."
BETTY: "Yeah, that could be a problem."
NANCY: "I had to say something since we're roommates and I'm tired of cleaning her mess."
BETTY: "I totally understand. I like things neat and organized too."
NANCY: "But the bigger problem is that she never pays her rent on time. She is late every month."
BETTY: "What are you going to do?"
NANCY: "I need to find a roommate soon. I can't afford the rent by myself. Do you know anyone looking for a roommate?"
BETTY: "Yes, I do."
NANCY: "Who?"
BETTY: "Me."
NANCY: "That would be awesome!"

JOAN: "Hi Carol. Why are you all dressed up?"
CAROL: "Oh hi Joan. Bill and I are going to a play tonight. My daughter is the lead actress."
JOAN: "Oh really? How exciting."
CAROL: "This will be her first performance. She is a drama student in college and she got the lead role."
JOAN: "I'd love to see her perform some day. Let me know when she will be on stage again."
CAROL: "Ok. I will. I'm so excited and proud of her."
JOAN: "Is she nervous?"
CAROL: "Yes, she is very nervous. But she loves acting, so this will be a true test for her."
JOAN: "Is this part of her school assignment?"
CAROL: "No. This is something she auditioned for on her own."
JOAN: "She won the lead part?"
CAROL: "Yeah. She was shocked. Her drama professor is coming too."
JOAN: "How does she feel about that?"
CAROL: "She's more nervous about her drama professor than the rest of the audience."
JOAN: "But she is not going to be graded on it."
CAROL: "Yeah, but she wants to do well in front of him."
JOAN: "I understand. Well, have a lovely time tonight!"

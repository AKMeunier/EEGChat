A: What are you doing?
B: I'm filling out my college application.
A: Do you need any help? I applied two years ago.
B: Yes, I do need help. Should I put my ethnicity?
A: It won't be used for or against you. It's really up to you.
B: Also, should I put all of my extracurriculars?
A: Put the ones that you were heavily involved in.
B: Next question, should I put anything in the "additional information" section?
A: If you feel like you need to say something that you didn't mention before, then yes.
B: Can I say I got an A when I really just got a B? 
A: What?! Of course not! They will ask for your transcript.
B: Oh, I didn't know that.

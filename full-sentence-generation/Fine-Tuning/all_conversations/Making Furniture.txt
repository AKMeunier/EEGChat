BILL: "Hey Carl, what are you doing with all that wood?"
CARL: "Hi Bill. I'm going to make a coffee table for Jill."
BILL: "That's nice! You know how to build things with wood?"
CARL: "Yeah. We just got back from furniture shopping and the price of furniture is expensive."
BILL: "So, you're going to make a coffee table instead of buying one?"
CARL: "That's right. Furniture is too expensive these days."
BILL: "You're lucky you know how to build things."
CARL: "My dad used to make furniture when he was younger. He taught me a lot."
BILL: "Hey, could you make me something if I pay you?"
CARL: "Sure. What is it?"
BILL: "Carol has been asking for a new desk. Can you build a desk?"
CARL: "Yeah. I built a desk for my daughter when she was in college. She still has it."
BILL: "How much would you charge me?"
CARL: "It depends on what kind of desk you want. Show me a picture later."
BILL: "Ok! I'll ask Carol to find a picture."
CARL: "Maybe I should quit being an accountant and go into furniture making instead."

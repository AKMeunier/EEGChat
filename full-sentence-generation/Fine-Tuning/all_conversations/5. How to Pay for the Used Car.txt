A: I really liked this car. How much are you asking for it?
B: I'm asking for $2,000. It has some minor problems.
A: Yes, my mechanic told me it was a quick fix.
B: So, you want to take the car?
A: Yes, I could write you a check right now.
B: That sounds good. Could I cash it today?
A: Yeah, go ahead. It will clear, don't worry.
B: Didn't mean anything by it.
A: No, it's cool. I know sometimes you have to wait for a check to clear.
B: Great. So, could you make it out to Michael Slender?
A: Sure thing. I'm going to put "Car Payment," under the memo.
B: Sounds good, man. I will take care of things at the DMV tomorrow.

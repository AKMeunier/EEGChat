A: I have an extra ticket to the Beyonce concert on Friday.
B: That's nice.
A: I was wondering if you want to come with me?
B: I really like Beyonce, but I'm busy on Friday.
A: Oh, I understand. Maybe we could go out some other time.
B: That's so sweet of you, but I don't think so.
A: Why not?
B: You're not really my type.
A: How do you know if you won't give me a chance?
B: Well, your insistence makes you seem a little desperate.
A: I'm not desperate. I've just liked you for a long time.
B: Again, that's sweet, but I'm not interested.

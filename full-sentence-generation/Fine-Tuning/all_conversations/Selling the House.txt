DAD: "Hey Jeff. Are you ok?"
JEFF: "Hi Dad. Yeah, I'm just a little sad that we are selling my childhood home."
DAD: "I know. I'm sad too. But it's just too big for your mother and me."
JEFF: "I understand. I just have a lot of memories here."
DAD: "Me too. This is the first home your mother and I bought."
JEFF: "Do you remember all of our holiday parties here? Everyone came to our house."
DAD: "Of course I remember them. Those were the best times."
JEFF: "Now I'm married and have a family of my own."
DAD: "I wish we didn't have to sell it, but we can no longer take care of it. We're getting old and it's too much work."
JEFF: "Do you know who bought our house?"
DAD: "A young couple with two kids. They seem like a loving family."
JEFF: "Where will you and mom go?"
DAD: "We found a beautiful, small condo a few blocks away."
JEFF: "That's nice. Will there be enough room when the grandchildren visit?"
DAD: "Yes. We have an extra room for guests, so your kids can stay over any time."
JEFF: "Where's Mom?"
DAD: "She's at the fabric store. She wants to sew new curtains for the condo."

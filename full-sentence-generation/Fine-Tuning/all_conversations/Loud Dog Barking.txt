KATHY: "Hi Carol. You look tired today."
CAROL: "I am tired. I didn't get any sleep last night."
KATHY: "Why?"
CAROL: "Our neighbor's dog would not stop barking. He barked all night long."
KATHY: "That's awful! Did you complain to your neighbor?"
CAROL: "I knocked on his door, but he didn't answer. I don't think he was home."
KATHY: "What did you do all night?"
CAROL: "I couldn't sleep, so I tried to read a book. But the dog's barking kept distracting me. So, I just watched TV."
KATHY: "I would be so angry. You should've called the police."
CAROL: "I didn't want to bother the police with a barking dog."
KATHY: "I would have called them. What if there was an emergency at your neighbor's house and the dog was trying to alert someone."
CAROL: "That's true. I didn't think about that. But this dog usually barks because he's bored."
KATHY: "That's annoying."
CAROL: "I know."
KATHY: "Hey Carol. Is that your neighbor? He's walking towards us."
CAROL: "What is he holding?"
KATHY: "It looks like a plate of cookies."

BOBBY: "Hey Steve, what did your mom pack for your lunch today?"
STEVE: "Hey Bobby. She packs me the same lunch every day. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cookies, and milk."
BOBBY: "I got something new today. It looks like a tuna sandwich. I'm not sure I like it."
STEVE: "I love tuna sandwiches. Do you want to trade?"
BOBBY: "Sure! But will your mom get mad?"
STEVE: "No. She won't know. I won't tell her."
BOBBY: "Do you ever buy the school lunch?"
STEVE: "No, it looks gross."
BOBBY: "It's actually not bad. Some dishes are pretty good."
STEVE: "Which ones have you tried?"
BOBBY: "The spaghetti and pizza are good. But the hamburgers and burritos are terrible. They taste like cardboard."
STEVE: "That's awful! Maybe I'll buy lunch when the cafeteria serves spaghetti and pizza. Those are my favorite dishes at home."
BOBBY: "They're pretty good, but not as good as our moms' cooking."
STEVE: "Are you done with lunch? Let's go out to recess."
BOBBY: "Yeah. Let's go!"

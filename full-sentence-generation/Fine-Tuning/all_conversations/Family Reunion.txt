ROBERT: "Mom, are we having a big party tonight?"
MOM: "Yes, Robert. All of our relatives are coming. Did you forget?"
ROBERT: "Oh yeah. It's our annual family reunion."
MOM: "How could you forget? We have a big party every year. This year it is at our house."
ROBERT: "I remember it was at Uncle Walter's house last year. That was fun."
MOM: "Do you need any help?"
ROBERT: "Yes. Could you please go to the store and buy some ice?"
MOM: "I made some lemonade and I want to keep it cold during the party."
ROBERT: "That's a good idea. It's going to be hot today."
MOM: "I hope the food stays fresh."
ROBERT: "I'm sure it will be fine. What are you making?"
MOM: "It's going to be a potluck. I am serving barbeque ribs and potatoes."
ROBERT: "Do you know what other people are bringing."
MOM: "I think some people are going to bring salads, appetizers, and desserts."
ROBERT: "Sounds like a feast."
MOM: "I think everyone is coming, except Aunt Linda. She's feeling sick today."
ROBERT: "That's too bad. She is my favorite aunt."
MOM: "I know. She's my favorite sister."
ROBERT: "I can't wait to see all of my cousins."
MOM: "They're excited to see you too. But right now, please go buy some ice."

KEVIN: "Dad, can you help me with my school project?"
DAD: "Sure, Kevin. What is your assignment?"
KEVIN: "We have to construct a building using any materials around the house."
DAD: "What were you thinking about building?"
KEVIN: "I want to build a skyscraper."
DAD: "That should be fun. Any ideas about the materials?"
KEVIN: "I'm not sure. I was thinking about using cardboard boxes."
DAD: "That's a great idea. We have a lot of old boxes. I saved them after we moved here."
KEVIN: "Where are they?"
DAD: "They're in the garage. Help me bring them into the house."
KEVIN: "Ok. Where should we put them?"
DAD: "Let's put them in the living room. It's the biggest room in the house. There's plenty of space to make a mess."
KEVIN: "Mom isn't going to be happy with all the mess."
DAD: "That's ok. She can help us too."
KEVIN: "Ok. What should I do first?"
DAD: "Why don't you design the building and then we can create it."
KEVIN: "That's a good plan. Thanks for your help, Dad."
DAD: "It's my pleasure. I'm an architect. Building is my specialty."

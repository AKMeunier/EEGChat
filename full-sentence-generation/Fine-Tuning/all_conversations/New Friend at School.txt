MOM: "Jane, how was school today?"
JANE: "Mom, it was fun. I made a new friend."
MOM: "That's nice. What's her name?"
JANE: "Her name is Cindy."
MOM: "Is she new to your school?"
JANE: "Yeah, she's a new student. She moved here from Seattle, Washington."
MOM: "You have an aunt who lives in Seattle."
JANE: "I know. I like Seattle. It's beautiful there, but it rains too much."
MOM: "Yeah. That's why we're staying in sunny California."
JANE: "Cindy and I have a lot in common. We both like drawing, playing with dogs, and eating pizza."
MOM: "You should invite her over for dinner one night."
JANE: "Can we, Mom?"
MOM: "Sure. We can order pizza."
JANE: "Maybe I'll ask her if she can come over on Friday."
MOM: "Ok. Let's invite her parents too. We can get to know them."
JANE: "That's a good idea. They don't have any friends here, yet."

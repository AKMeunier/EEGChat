Shannon:  I love this restaurant.  
Bill:  Me too.  It is so underrated.
Shannon:  I agree.  Not too many people know about it.
Bill:  People do not know how great the food is here.
Shannon:  Don't tell anyone.  This place will get crowded.  I hate crowded places.
Bill:  Me too.  However, if this place doesn't get more customers, they may go out of business.

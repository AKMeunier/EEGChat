HENRY: "Susan, what should we do this weekend?"
SUSAN: "I don't know. What would you like to do?"
HENRY: "Should we take the kids camping."
SUSAN: "That sounds like a fun plan."
HENRY: "Do you know what the weather forecast for this weekend?"
SUSAN: "No. I have to check."
HENRY: "I think it is supposed to be sunny and clear."
SUSAN: "That's perfect weather for camping."
HENRY: "We can go fishing too."
SUSAN: "The kids are going to love it."
HENRY: "Let's not tell them yet."
SUSAN: "Why?"
HENRY: "I need to make a reservation. There may not be space available."
SUSAN: "Oh yeah. We better think of another option just in case."
HENRY: "Yeah. How about going to the beach?"
SUSAN: "That would be fun too."
HENRY: "Let me try to make a reservation for camping first."
SUSAN: "Ok. Here's the number."

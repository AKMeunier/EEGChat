JANE: "Hey Kevin, do you want to try the new diner down the street?"
KEVIN: "Sure. I hear they have really good food especially their omelets."
JANE: "Susan went their last weekend and said it was the best breakfast place in town."
KEVIN: "Yeah, I heard the same thing from Janet. She waited an hour for a table."
JANE: "I don't think I can wait an hour. I'm hungry right now."
KEVIN: "Do you want to make breakfast at home?"
JANE: "Ok. What do you want to eat?"
KEVIN: "I'd like a ham and cheese omelet."
JANE: "That sounds good. Do we have all of the ingredients?"
KEVIN: "Well, we only need eggs, ham, and cheese."
JANE: "I think we may be out of ham. I used the last few slices for a sandwich yesterday."
KEVIN: "Ok. How about a vegetable omelet?"
JANE: "That's good too. We have green peppers, mushrooms, and onions."
KEVIN: "That's perfect."
JANE: "Great! I'll brew some coffee and you make the omelet."
KEVIN: "I don't know how to make an omelet."
JANE: "You don't? Well, I don't either."
KEVIN: "Let's just go to the new diner."
JANE: "That sounds like a better plan."

MARK: "Hey Jim. Are you entering the school talent show?"
JIM: "No way, Mark. I don't have any talents."
MARK: "I'm entering the talent show."
JIM: "What are you going to do?"
MARK: "I'm going to juggle while sitting on a unicycle. I know how to juggle really well."
JIM: "Do you have a unicycle?"
MARK: "I'm going to use my grandfather's unicycle. He used to ride one in the circus."
JIM: "That's cool. I wish I had a talent."
MARK: "You do. Think of something you're really good at."
JIM: "I know some magic tricks. My brother taught me last summer."
MARK: "Magic tricks are cool! You should enter. The winner gets a new computer."
JIM: "I've never been on stage before. I would be too scared to stand in front of an audience."
MARK: "I've never been on stage either. I think it will be fun."
JIM: "I'll just cheer you on from the audience."
MARK: "Thanks! Do you want to watch me practice?"
JIM: "Sure! Can you teach me how to juggle?"
MARK: "Of course! Let's go practice together at my house tonight."

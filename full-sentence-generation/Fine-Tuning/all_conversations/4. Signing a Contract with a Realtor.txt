A: Hello, Mr. Rogers. How are you today?
B: I'm doing well, Wendy. How are you?
A: I'm great, thanks. So are you ready to make a decision?
B: I certainly am. I'm going with your firm.
A: Oh, that's great news, Mr. Rogers.
B: Okay, so what's next?
A: I have a standard contract we use. You can look it over if you like.
B: Sure I will, but can you give me an overview?
A: It basically reads that you agree to have us act as your agent.
B: I still have the final say on the deal though, right?
A: Of course, you do, Mr. Rogers.
B: I just wanted to be clear on that. Thanks.

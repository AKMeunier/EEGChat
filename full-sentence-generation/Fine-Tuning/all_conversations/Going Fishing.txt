DAD: "Billy, are you all packed?"
BILLY: "No, Dad. I can't find my fishing pole."
DAD: "Where did you see it last?"
BILLY: "In the garage. I'll look again."
DAD: "Ok. I'm almost done packing too. I just need to load the tents into the car."
BILLY: "I found my fishing pole. It was behind the skis."
DAD: "Good. What is your mom doing?"
BILLY: "She is packing food and snacks into the ice chest."
DAD: "Hopefully, we will catch some fish to eat too."
BILLY: "Yeah. Dad, where is your fishing pole?"
DAD: "I forgot it. Thanks for reminding me."
BILLY: "Are we going to the same campsite?"
DAD: "No. I want to try a new place."
BILLY: "Cool. Can I bring my camera?"
DAD: "Of course. But be careful not to lose it."
BILLY: "I'll be careful. I want to take a lot of pictures."
DAD: "Make sure to take pictures of our fish."
BILLY: "I hope we catch big ones. I love camping and fishing."
DAD: "I love spending time as a family."

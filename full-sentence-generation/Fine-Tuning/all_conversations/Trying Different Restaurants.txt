JENNIFER: "Do you want to try a new restaurant tonight?"
LINDA: "Sure. I'm kind of getting sick of the same place."
JENNIFER: "Me too. What kind of food do you want to eat?"
LINDA: "Do you want to try Indian?"
JENNIFER: "Ok. I've never had Indian food before, so you'll have to choose the place."
LINDA: "I've never had it before either."
JENNIFER: "Then why do you want to go there?"
LINDA: "To try something different."
JENNIFER: "Let's check out the reviews online."
LINDA: "That's a good idea."
JENNIFER: "There are many restaurants we haven't tried."
LINDA: "Should we try a new one each week?"
JENNIFER: "Yeah. That will be fun."
LINDA: "Ok, so we'll have Indian tonight."
JENNIFER: "What about next week?"
LINDA: "Let's decide that next week. One place at a time."
JENNIFER: "I'm hungry."
LINDA: "Me too. Let's find a restaurant soon."

LISA: "Hey Sally. Do you want to be my partner for the class project?"
SALLY: "Sure, Lisa. I'm glad you asked me. I don't have a partner."
LISA: "Do you want to meet after school and work on it together?"
SALLY: "I can't today. It's my grandmother's 80th birthday and we're taking her out to dinner. How about tomorrow?"
LISA: "I can't tomorrow. I have soccer practice after school. I can meet on Thursday."
SALLY: "I can meet on Thursday too. Do you want to come to my house?"
LISA: "Sure. I'll ask my mom tonight."
SALLY: "Ok. We can walk together. My house is very close to school."
LISA: "Should we start on the project before Thursday?"
SALLY: "That sounds like a good plan."
LISA: "I can work on the written portion. Do you want to do the pictures?"
SALLY: "Yeah. I'm pretty good at drawing."
LISA: "I know. I've seen your drawings before. You are very talented."
SALLY: "Thanks. My parents are artists. They taught me how to draw at an early age."
LISA: "That's nice. I wish I knew how to draw well."
SALLY: "I can teach you."
LISA: "Ok. But we better finish the project first."
SALLY: "You're right. This is going to be fun. We make a good team."

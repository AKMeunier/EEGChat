BILL: "Hey Todd. What are you doing today?"
TODD: "Hey Bill. My wife and I are going to buy our daughter a car."
BILL: "Wow! That's quite a gift!"
TODD: "I know. It's a graduation gift."
BILL: "Are you going to buy a new or used car?"
TODD: "Used. It will be her first vehicle, so she doesn't need a brand new one."
BILL: "I'm actually selling my car. Would you be interested?"
TODD: "Is it the red one?"
BILL: "Yeah, that's the one."
TODD: "My daughter would love that car."
BILL: "It's in great condition. I've taken good care of it."
TODD: "How many miles does it have on it? And, how much do you want for it?"
BILL: "35,000 miles. $7,000."
TODD: "That's pretty good. Why are you selling it?"
BILL: "My wife and I are having a baby. We need to get a bigger car."
TODD: "Congratulations on your new baby!"
BILL: "Thanks. Would you like to take a look at the car?"
TODD: "Yeah. Can I take it for a test drive?"
BILL: "Of course."

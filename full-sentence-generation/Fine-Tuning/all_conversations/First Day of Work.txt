Erin:  How's your first day at work going?
Ryan:  Good.  I'm getting to know a lot of people in the office.
Erin:  Have you met Larry?  He's our technical support guy.
Ryan:  Yes, I had to call him about my computer.
Erin:  Make sure you're nice to him. If he doesn't like you, he won't help you right away.
Ryan:  Good to know!
Erin:  Our office goes out to lunch together every Tuesday.  You should join us.
Ryan:  Ok.  Jane mentioned that too.
Erin:  Good.  Well, let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Ryan:  Thanks!

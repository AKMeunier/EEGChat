Don:  Do you believe that coffee prevents cancer?
Jane:  I want to believe it.  I love coffee.
Don:  But your coffee is not very healthy.
Jane:  Why do you say that?
Don:  You put lots of cream and sugar in your coffee.
Jane:  It tastes better that way.
Don:  You should drink it black like me.
Jane:  It's too bitter.
Don:  I don't think your coffee will prevent cancer.
Jane:  I'm still going to believe it.

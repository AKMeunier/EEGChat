MOM: "Sally, what are you doing?"
SALLY: "I'm making posters, Mom. Our school needs to raise money for a field trip."
MOM: "Why do you need to raise money?"
SALLY: "We want to go on an overnight camping trip and the school doesn't have enough money."
MOM: "How are you going to try to raise money?"
SALLY: "We are going to have a car wash."
MOM: "A car wash? Where and how?"
SALLY: "It's going to be at the school parking lot and the students and teachers are going to volunteer to wash cars for donations."
MOM: "That's a great idea! Can parents help, too?"
SALLY: "Sure! I'll let my teacher know."
MOM: "When is the car wash?"
SALLY: "Saturday at noon."
MOM: "What will the weather be like on Saturday?"
SALLY: "I don't know. I haven't checked."
MOM: "According to the weather report, it's going to be clear and sunny."
SALLY: "That's perfect weather for a car wash."
MOM: "How many posters are you going to make?"
SALLY: "As many as possible. Karen and Jane are coming over to help too."
MOM: "Where are you going to hang these posters?"
SALLY: "All over town. I hope many people see them."

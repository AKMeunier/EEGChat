MARK: "Hey Billy. Do you want to come over after school?"
BILLY: "Hey Mark. No. I have to finish my chores. I didn't do them all week, so now I have to do them all today."
MARK: "What do you have to do?"
BILLY: "Rake the yard and clean my room."
MARK: "Is that going to take a long time?"
BILLY: "Have you seen my room? It looks like a tornado went through it."
MARK: "Why didn't you clean it before?"
BILLY: "I hate cleaning. Do you have chores?"
MARK: "Yeah, but I try to finish them as soon as possible."
BILLY: "You're smart! Now, I have to spend Friday afternoon doing chores."
MARK: "That's too bad. I got a new video game I wanted to show you."
BILLY: "Do you want to help me with my chores?"
MARK: "No way! I'm going to enjoy my Friday afternoon."
BILLY: "Well, I better get to work or I'll be doing it after dinner too."
MARK: "Finish your chores earlier next time."
BILLY: "I know. I say that every week."
